# üîß Avatar Persistence Fix Instructions

## Issue Summary
User avatars are not showing in comments because the database is missing the `author_avatar` column in the `comments` table.

## Evidence
- ‚úÖ Frontend correctly sends avatar URL: `'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJzX6ahfWeEe8P7ovVJHwdJ-8YQtzxQ0IplBswA2cCCTG5lUw4=s64'`
- ‚úÖ API correctly processes the data
- ‚ùå Database returns `"authorAvatar": null` for all comments
- ‚úÖ All other comment functionality works perfectly

## Root Cause
The live database table `comments` is missing the `author_avatar` column. The application code is correct, but the database schema needs to be updated.

## Fix Required

### Option 1: SQL Command (Recommended)
Run this SQL command in your database management tool (phpMyAdmin, etc.):

```sql
ALTER TABLE comments ADD COLUMN author_avatar TEXT NULL AFTER author_email;
```

### Option 2: Use the SQL File
Execute the commands in `FIX_AVATAR_DATABASE.sql` file step by step.

## Verification Steps

1. **Before Fix**: Test current state
```bash
curl -X GET "https://luvbudstv.com/api/tasks_simple.php?endpoint=comments&task_id=IT-002a" | grep authorAvatar
# Should show: "authorAvatar": null
```

2. **Run the Database Fix**
```sql
ALTER TABLE comments ADD COLUMN author_avatar TEXT NULL AFTER author_email;
```

3. **After Fix**: Create a new comment and test
```bash
# Create a new comment via the UI
# Then check:
curl -X GET "https://luvbudstv.com/api/tasks_simple.php?endpoint=comments&task_id=IT-002a" | grep authorAvatar
# Should show: "authorAvatar": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/..."
```

## Why This Happened
The development environment may have been set up with different database schema files, or the production database was created before the avatar feature was added. The application code is already correct and ready to use avatars once the database is updated.

## Impact After Fix
- ‚úÖ User avatars will display in all new comments
- ‚úÖ Existing comments will show default avatar (can be updated)
- ‚úÖ No code changes needed - everything else is working correctly

## Additional Fixes Applied
I've also fixed a notification error that was occurring:
- Fixed `truncateContent` function to handle undefined content safely
- This prevents console errors during comment creation

## Status
- üîß **Database fix required**: Run the SQL command above
- ‚úÖ **All other functionality working**: Comments, @mentions, GitHub integration, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Code is ready**: No application changes needed
