**Scrum Master Recommendation:**
This backlog provides a solid foundation for the 7-week TaskMaster migration. The epic structure aligns with business value delivery, and the sprint planning enables incremental releases. Regular backlog refinement sessions will ensure we stay on track and adapt to changing requirements.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve this backlog structure
2. Conduct initial sprint planning for Sprint 1
3. Set up team ceremonies and communication channels
4. Begin Sprint 1 development work
