   - Events have timestamps and agent information
   - Types: agent_started, agent_completed, agent_failed

3. **Perform Actions and Watch Events:**
   - Switch to other tabs and perform actions
   - Return to Events tab to see new events logged

### **Step 7: Test Different Departments**

1. **Try Different Task Types:**
   - Select tasks from different departments
   - Notice department-specific:
     - Color coding (Tech=Blue, Marketing=Green, Sales=Purple, Accounting=Orange)
     - Specialized subtasks
     - Department-relevant skills and recommendations

2. **Department-Specific Features:**
   - **Tech Tasks:** Security reviews, code standards, technical architecture
   - **Sales Tasks:** CRM integration, pipeline management

   - **Accounting Tasks:** Compliance, financial processes

### **Step 8: Test Error Handling**

1. **Verify Graceful Degradation:**
   - If BMAD service fails to initialize, should show error message
   - Failed operations should display error states, not crash
   - Retry mechanisms should work

2. **Check Console for Errors:**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Look for JavaScript errors in Console tab
   - Should see BMAD initialization logs, minimal errors
