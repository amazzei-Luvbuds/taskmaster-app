  - MeetingTranscriptionUpload.tsx - Main UI component
  - URL import functionality - Supports Zoom/Fathom/Google Meet
  - File upload - .txt file processing
  - Manual text input - Direct paste capability
  - Dark mode support - Recently added
  - Two-step process - Extract ‚Üí Create workflow

  2. AI Processing Layer ‚úÖ

  - aiTranscriptionProcessor.ts - Core processing logic
  - Gemini integration - Mistral removed as requested
  - Smart extraction - Comprehensive task details
  - Department mapping - 12 department categories
  - Type definitions - Strong TypeScript types

  3. Backend API Layer ‚úÖ

  - fetch-transcript.php - URL scraping service
  - Platform support - Zoom, Fathom, Google Meet
  - Security validation - Domain whitelist
  - Error handling - Comprehensive error responses

  4. Data Layer ‚úÖ

  - Task store integration - Zustand state management
  - Database persistence - Via existing task API
  - Type safety - Full TypeScript coverage

  üö® IDENTIFIED GAPS & RECOMMENDATIONS

  üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

  1. API Key Security Risk

  // CURRENT: Exposed in frontend
  const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY;
  RISK: API key exposed in client-side code
  FIX: Move Gemini calls to backend proxy

  2. Missing Error Recovery

  - No retry mechanism for failed Gemini calls
  - No fallback when URL parsing fails
  - No partial success handling

  üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY GAPS

  3. Limited URL Support

  - Only supports public URLs
  - No OAuth for private meeting recordings
  - No support for authenticated Zoom/Google Meet links

  4. No Caching Strategy

  - Gemini API calls on every extraction
  - No transcript content caching
  - No processed results persistence

  5. Missing Validation

  - No transcript quality assessment
  - No AI confidence scoring
  - No extracted task validation

  üü¢ LOW PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS

  6. User Experience Gaps

  - No progress indicators for long AI processing
  - No preview mode for URL content before processing
  - No batch processing for multiple transcripts

  7. Monitoring & Analytics

  - No usage tracking
  - No error rate monitoring
  - No AI performance metrics

  üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

  Priority 1: Security Fix

  // Create: api/process-transcription.php
  <?php
  // Move Gemini API calls to backend
  // Keep API key server-side only

  Priority 2: Error Resilience

  // Add retry logic with exponential backoff
  // Implement partial failure handling
  // Add user-friendly error messages

  Priority 3: Enhanced URL Support

  // Add OAuth integration for private meetings
  // Support authenticated URLs
  // Implement session-based access

  ‚úÖ SYSTEM STRENGTHS

  1. Clean Architecture - Well-separated concerns
  2. Type Safety - Comprehensive TypeScript usage
  3. User-Centric Design - Intuitive two-step workflow
  4. Extensible - Easy to add new platforms
  5. AI-Optimized - Smart prompt engineering
  6. Integration Ready - Seamless dashboard integration

  ---
  üéØ FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION

  The system WILL work end-to-end:
  1. ‚úÖ URL import from meeting platforms
  2. ‚úÖ AI processing with Gemini
  3. ‚úÖ Task extraction with metadata
  4. ‚úÖ Dashboard card creation
  5. ‚úÖ Smart department/person assignment

  Minor deployment requirement:
  - Upload fetch-transcript.php to your server's /api/ directory

  üéØ DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE

  Let's start with Phase 1.1 - the most critical improvement:

  TASK 1: Error Recovery & Retry Logic

  Files to Create/Modify:
  1. src/services/retryService.ts - Retry logic utility
  2. src/services/geminiService.ts - Enhanced with retry
  3. api/gemini-proxy.php - Server-side retry logic
  4. src/components/MeetingTranscriptionUpload.tsx - Better error UX

  Implementation Steps:
  1. ‚úÖ Exponential Backoff Retry
  2. ‚úÖ Partial Success Handling
  3. ‚úÖ User-Friendly Error Messages
  4. ‚úÖ Graceful Degradation

  Would you like me to:

  A) Start implementing Phase 1.1 (Error Recovery) immediately?
  B) Create detailed specifications for all phases first?
  C) Focus on a specific phase that interests you most?
  D) Implement a different priority order based on your needs?
