\f0\fs24 \cf0 Okay, so if we could set up a tool that reads all the emails of the user, each user would have its own dashboard. And if there's any transcriptions of any meetings in Fathom, Google Gemini, or Zoom, because we can train it to open up that email and find that link, it could then open up that link, find the transcription of the meeting, and automatically put it into the area where it breaks that down into tasks and gives you personal tasks based on what's inside your email and what's inside of your meetings. And then if you'd like, you can have a toggle button to like a checkbox to either add them to the dashboard of the Taskmaster or just leave them in a queue on your own personal dashboard or delete them because they're irrelevant. \

If we're able to take all the emails and all the meetings and create a knowledge base, that becomes the information used for the person's chatbot so people on teams can communicate and ask questions based on things that were in the meeting to this chatbot based on all the meetings that that person's had. So instead of immediately asking them, there might be a way where they can either send an email and an email agent that's replying and creating a draft message is using the knowledge that it has based on all the other data that was collected in the emails and all the other transcriptions, sorry, all the other transcriptions of all the meetings they were participating in to help answer those emails and/or possibly answer chatbots. As well as creating a new section which is called Legacy Knowledge. So as people are having conversations, we need to create a whole other panel that's for legacy knowledge.\

Also, I want the email tool to go in there and create flags that identify certain things like meeting notes, promotional items, urgent must-read, or requires human interaction to continue, and create a list of other ones that would make sense for an employee to have as tags inside their business email.}
