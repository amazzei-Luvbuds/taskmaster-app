# Story 1.3: Implement Role-Based Authorization

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** role-based authorization for pin management,
**so that** only authorized users can create/modify global pins while maintaining security.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User roles are properly defined and stored in the system
2. Authorization middleware validates permissions before pin operations
3. Leadership role can create/update/delete any global pins
4. Manager role can create/update global pins but not delete others'
5. Employee role can only view global pins, not modify
6. Personal pins remain accessible to all authenticated users
7. Error messages clearly indicate permission issues

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] User Role Management System (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create or extend user_roles table
  - [ ] Define role hierarchy (leadership > manager > employee)
  - [ ] Add role assignment functionality
  - [ ] Create role validation utilities

- [ ] Permission Matrix Implementation (AC: 2, 3, 4, 5)
  - [ ] Create permission matrix for pin operations
  - [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) middleware
  - [ ] Validate permissions before database operations
  - [ ] Support operation-level permissions (create/read/update/delete)

- [ ] Authorization Middleware (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] Create reusable authorization middleware
  - [ ] Integrate with existing authentication system
  - [ ] Handle edge cases (missing roles, invalid tokens)
  - [ ] Provide clear error responses

- [ ] Personal Pin Protection (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Ensure personal pins remain user-specific
  - [ ] Users can only modify their own personal pins
  - [ ] Leadership cannot override personal pin preferences
  - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility

- [ ] Security Validation (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Prevent privilege escalation attempts
  - [ ] Validate user identity on every request
  - [ ] Rate limiting for pin operations
  - [ ] Audit suspicious authorization attempts

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- `api/auth/roles.php` - Role management utilities
- `api/middleware/` - Authorization middleware
- `api/config.php` - Role configuration
- `database/user_roles.sql` - Role schema

### Permission Matrix
```php
const PIN_PERMISSIONS = [
  'leadership' => [
    'global_pins' => ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete'],
    'personal_pins' => ['read'] // Can view but not modify others'
  ],
  'manager' => [
    'global_pins' => ['create', 'read', 'update'],
    'personal_pins' => []
  ],
  'employee' => [
    'global_pins' => ['read'],
    'personal_pins' => []
  ]
];
```

### Role Hierarchy
- **Leadership**: Full global pin control, can override any global pin
- **Manager**: Can create and update global pins, cannot delete others'
- **Employee**: Read-only access to global pins
- **All Roles**: Full control over their own personal pins

### Security Considerations
- JWT token validation on every request
- Role verification against user database
- Protection against role manipulation attacks
- Audit logging for authorization failures

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for permission matrix
- Integration tests with actual user roles
- Security penetration testing
- Authorization bypass attempt testing
- Performance testing with role lookups
