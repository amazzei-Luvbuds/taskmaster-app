Hubspot and parent child clean up update  - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Mike Metoyer: What up, Alex? I'm good, brother. How you doing?
Alex Mazzei: What's going on?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, as far as uh far as what?
Alex Mazzei: I'm all right. You guys get anywhere like any updates on like things that are moving forward.
Mike Metoyer: Um, so I kind of I haven't really been touching too many IT projects to be honest with you, so I I can't necessarily answer that. I know um HubSpot, I don't know if Zach was involved, but uh Kenan um and IT team I'm assuming um decided to put a little pause on the uh HubSpot project just due to uh cleaning up some uh company records and contacts because he was telling me in Dynamics he might have to create new or different forms to actually plug into Sky Villa um if we even go that route. He was like I was looking at a couple other options too. So, I'm not sure on uh on that piece, but yeah, we can hear a little more from him, but uh I did have something that I I did want to show you and and I could wait uh just to show you before we Yeah.
 
 
00:04:33
 
Mike Metoyer: So, everybody's in the call and they can see what I'm talking about. But, uh as we're cleaning up uh HubSpot just to match dynamics, just some of that data. Uh I actually looked into some of the fields. Um and there's actually a field called Big Commerce customer ID. Um, and so I guess before we we do make this transition to make web better, I was going to see if we could use that uh that middleware software or whatever to actually plug in the Big Commerce ID
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Mike Metoyer: number from the customer um into into HubSpot. I I don't know um if it's an option. Uh I just yeah was playing around with it and wanted to see.
Alex Mazzei: How you doing, Z?
Zach Ungerman: I'm doing well.
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Zach Ungerman: So, just Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, there's a few more people on the meeting, right?
Mike Metoyer: You uh you
Alex Mazzei: So, I I didn't want to go into too much details until we had everybody that were supposed to be on this main.
 
 
00:05:32
 
Alex Mazzei: It was like seven or eight people.
Mike Metoyer: There's a lot of people for sure.
Zach Ungerman: So, most of them are in the office. So, just wait for them to log on before we continue.
Mike Metoyer: Alex, you back home. Where you at? Damn. Okay. Jeez. Hopefully you're getting some good food out there, too.
Mike Martin: It's just Alex is join us. Looks like everybody. How are we doing?
Mike Metoyer: What's up? Good. How you guys doing?
Mike Martin: Good, good, good. How are you?
Zach Ungerman: Good.
Mike Metoyer: Good.
Mike Martin: Look at all those handsome faces, man. Good looking group.
Alex Mazzei: What's up, guys? I'm I'm in transition and there's like spotty uh cellular some.
Mike Martin: All right. Where what city are you in now, Alex?
Alex Mazzei: I don't know. It's Claremont for Mont. I don't know where the hell I am. New Hampshire.
Mike Martin: New Hampshire. All right. All right, guys.
 
 
00:08:28
 
Mike Martin: Well, I don't want to take everyone's time. This is a quick just update for everybody just to make sure we're all on the same page. We've got uh a bunch of things that are all pending each other is the way I'm going to describe it. So, we've got our HubSpot thing that we're dealing with. We have our middleware that we're dealing with. We have um the data cleanup process with the 80,000 uh entries that we've got to clean up. So, with with all of these things that we currently have in the air that are kind of all pending on this particular project, there has been a request from Kenan to to hold off for a little bit. so he can, you know, get some data cleaned up in the system. One of the things because Kenan is new, I want to make sure that everybody here understands holdups and pauses at this point in our project, I want defined and I want him to have all the resources he needs to limit that time. So when I hear two weeks of data, it scares the s*** out of me.
 
 
00:09:29
 
Mike Martin: I want to know what we're doing because you know an analogy that Matoyer gave me I think kind of rings true. We have plumbing and then we've got the water flow that goes in the plumbing and we do need to get this third party company building this out and part of that needs to I think happen at the same time that we're cleaning the data. And so because I'm hearing bits of information from Kenan, a little bit of information from Alex, little bit of information from Mike, I really want to close this gap here today and understand where we are. What are our true deadlines? Are we still on track to hit what we're we've all been talking about, which is 91, and have some true measurement here. Um, and with that, I'll open up the floor to anybody who wants to jump in and either correct me, set me straight, or or tell me everything I just said is accurate and give me some dates.
Alex Mazzei: Is is and Mike Mets with you?
Mike Martin: Mike Mets was invited to this meeting.
 
 
00:10:31
 
Mike Martin: I know he's on the meeting. He's not here, though. He was there. Uh, let me go grab him. I'll go walk over and grab him. I'll be right back. just uh kind of where I'm sitting at.
Alex Mazzei: Thank you.
Mike Martin: We have a meeting with Strawos today on how to better organize the parent child relationship in the system. Currently, we have all the data. It's in the system. However, when sales orders get created in Big Commerce with delivery addresses, those delivery addresses don't live on the customer record themselves. They just live on the sales orders. So, we need that data on um like new sales orders, new delivery addresses to be also applied to the customer record itself. So we have all the data sitting in one place. That's something Diana's and Mike are dealing with too. They're pulling we're pulling the customer data from Dynamics but all the addresses are not there. So we're to manipulate the delivery addresses to kind of uh link them to the correct parent account.
 
 
00:11:19
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah,
Mike Martin: The what's considered the parent account is the invoice account. Uh so that's the top level of it. So assuming that we think there's lower levels to that then we then we can reorganize the the delivery addresses to create chains. Um because right now the current way that we organize it through dynamics it's it's actually like a marketing module but it's it's a manual thing that we have to manually create the chain and all that. It's not efficient. The field is there but it's in the marketing section of the customer record. Got it. But I mean it's it it can live there. That's fine. And we just have to to ident correctly identify each of the company chains to make sure all the MSOs have all of their children underneath that chain. So we have the parent address which is the billing address and then we have the child addresses which are going to be delivery addresses shipping addresses.
Alex Mazzei: Was the the information from Emerald Intel able to help you at all, Kenan?
 
 
00:12:34
 
Mike Martin: We did not even cross check it with that. I mean that that data is important but it's it's all national, you know, that that's kind of encompassing everybody like people that we don't even serve. Um I mean it could be helpful for sales for sure. Um but we haven't cross- checked it. That that is something we can do whenever we we do our final audit. Um, that could be helpful in doing the USPS address format as well. Yep.
Mike Metoyer: So
Alex Mazzei: So basically what I'm hearing is you have the data that you're able to collect and you have two different One addresses. is the the shipping and one is the billing address. And you're using that information as the parent child relationship to set this up as a initial master sheet or master list.
Mike Martin: Right. In dynamics. Yep.
Alex Mazzei: And how confident are you everything that you need like and you're moving in the direction you need? Like what what support or help do you need from us?
 
 
00:13:30
 
Mike Martin: pretty confident because every pretty confident because every every address that comes from Big Commerce is a shipping address.
Alex Mazzei: Okay.
Mike Martin: They don't even denote billing address on their right. um that we did find billing addresses and the only reason I say this is because we found like a good bunch of PO addresses and we don't ship to PO so I'm assuming but those those addresses they might
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, you do have the billing
Mike Martin: but do those those billing addresses don't come over in the integration right so anything that is in Dynamics I can't understand is a shipping address in theory unless they mistakenly put their invoice address as a shipping address, which could happen, I guess. All right, guys. We're back.
Mike Metoyer: Well, and and Kenan, even with that, I would say the customers that do have a billing address, I would say less than 5% of our records, if that, actually use that billing address. Um, most people just use the shipping.
Mike Martin: We're invoicing. Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Uh yeah, for for uh like yeah, like our customers for invoicing.
 
 
00:14:36
 
Mike Martin: Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Yes. Um for sure. Uh specifically because we're not we're not in the 90s anymore where we're not hand mailing these invoices out. Um it's it's typically via email and so they want to actually see what shipping address that the invoice is tied to. Um,
Mike Martin: Gota way to the shipping address because that's what the invoice comes with. But that's what our customer prefers.
Mike Metoyer: So I guess I guess just touching on on So I I is.
Mike Martin: You can pay me and I can throw it in the trash if you want. I'm happy to do that. It'd be faster. But uh I wanted to uh point out that Mike is organizing our data that we pulled um through Big Commerce to kind of um simulate what we want to see in dynamics um pinpointing which ones would be the chains and which ones are their child accounts which are the delivery um addresses. And then the third part of that is creating like a region which as you know Mike like for example Curleaf likes their building per states um that's what we would consider a region but there's other MSOs's that handle their AP across different states but that's the the next step of that.
 
 
00:16:12
 
Mike Martin: So again, just just to recap, so I want to make sure because bringing Mike in, which I didn't have him in involved initially, but understanding he's working on parent child relationships, which kind of all ties into the HubSpot thing, which all ties into the middleware. So, I just want to get on the same page real quick with everybody and again close some dates off and make sure that we're not duplicating each other's work. And especially if he's put in enough time on this, we can run with what he has. Uh or vice versa, if someone else is already putting in time on this, we we just get together and collaborate. So, Alex, I know you had a question for Mike. That's why I went to go grab him. You want to jump back on?
Alex Mazzei: No, I just know that between what he was showing me in his office and some of the Google meets that we had of the data in his Excel spreadsheets, he had a lot of information organized. And I know Kenan and him were working together on that.
 
 
00:17:09
 
Alex Mazzei: And I just wanted him to be in this meeting because I feel like he has the ability that he's understanding what needs to happen, but he's also looking at the information. So when he's looking at it, he knows if it's right or wrong. and and I know Keenan has the back end of the ERP stuff as his skill set. So having both of those people in this meeting was paramount for me.
Mike Martin: So I mean everybody on the line here, everybody understands the parent child relationship. Everybody understands the middleware. Everybody understands what we're trying to get accomplished with dynamics, HubSpot, and Big Commerce. Is there anyone that's on the line that does not understand what we're trying to get accomplished? Then as we move forward, it's going to make sense because I need to know where we're at with timelines. When when's my next deadline? When what what's when's my next action item, deliverable? Where are we at? Meeting today with Straw Bus to review the best way to organize this data in Dynamics.
 
 
00:18:12
 
Mike Martin: Um once we have that methodology, then we can import the clean data that Mike has. Um we'll have to work on a import template for that. Um but once that's established, we should have correct hierarchy. We're also going to have to talk to strus about how we classify those uh regional operators and remove the tree. So I guess by the end of day we can probably have a good idea of how long the system will take based on what they tell us. I'd say so. Yeah. So then once they tell us that what's the next step? Organizing the data. um getting the data set up and in an import template that Kenan can use to upload to dynamics and then subsequent mail file and again I'm the idiot in the room speaking we're doing all this in sandbox. Yes. Right. Everybody understands we're doing all this in sandbox. Okay. So then when's an expectation that this will be done in sandbox, approved in sandbox that we can I can look forward to then moving forward with the other projects or can these other projects be moving simultaneously with this project?
 
 
00:19:18
 
Mike Martin: Right. Where we at with the middleware company? We I sent an email a couple days ago told and told them to hold off for at least a couple weeks. Okay. Why a couple weeks? Why not five days? Why not two days? Why not three days? Because I don't know what the timeline Strauss is going to give us. on or even if they have I don't even know if if they have the current um hierarchy relationship even in dynamics. I don't know they do. So okay. Yeah, it's there. So it could be five days. It could be two weeks. Okay. What what I'm going to say is we probably this meeting is probably premature understanding what I just found out. Probably need to have this meeting after you we have this meeting with Strao. So we're going to put this back on the calendar probably for Monday. That's okay with everybody else. Any other questions I need to understand what Mike?
 
 
00:20:06
 
Mike Martin: Go ahead.
Mike Metoyer: Yeah. So, uh I know you guys are you have a huge focus on uh Dynamics, which obviously that's going to be our source of truth. Uh when we're actually porting it over to HubSpot, um you know, originally uh they uh Instrumental Group was going to use the domain name as far as like uh connecting the accounts um and emails. Um I don't know if that's going to be the best way. So, I I was playing around in HubSpot and there is actually a field where you can input a Bitcommerce customer ID number. Um, and so with that, I don't know if we could uh create a workflow or have Make Web Better import that information from Big Commerce uh before we shut it off just so it's an easy match. Um, but yeah, I just wanted to ask you guys on that. It looks like Danny um is in charge of the workflows on that side.
Mike Martin: So once once an order is created in Big Commerce, it gets pushed to both Dynamics and HubSpot.
 
 
00:21:01
 
Mike Martin: That has to have a unique identifier that that's the same across both platforms, right? So that's the field that you're trying to put into HubSpot. Mike, that unique identifier, how's it being read right now, Mike?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, it's essentially uh Yeah.
Mike Martin: email.
Mike Metoyer: Uh I I don't know. Uh that's a question for Mike Martin. I think he has it uh based on email, the contacts.
Mike Martin: Yeah. Yeah. So uh the the flow goes uh email which goes uh which is a contact and um HubSpot automatically generates uh the primary company associated with the contact as long as it's uh a URL that's readable. So, if it's Mike M at Gmail, then it wouldn't create a uh company associated with Mike Martin because it's a Gmail account. So, there are some scenarios like that in HubSpot, but for the most part, that's how it's set up currently where it's automated by URL uh on the email. How how confident do you guys feel about the organization of the companies in in HubSpot where we can reference that as far as like okay so this company belongs to this chain HubSpot I feel we haven't done a
 
 
00:22:21
 
Mike Metoyer: I don't think we should go that route, but what do you what do you think, Martin?
Mike Martin: lot of hygiene anything that's been done has been automated that's probably going to be accurate but when it's um there are some situations where there's secondary tertiary level like Schwaz is a good example where it's not smart enough to read that and then we've been some people have been doing it by hand where they they have uh uh star buds and then they show primary is schwaz secondary is emeralds fields and they've been kind of just uh dragging and dropping that. So the question we have to ask ourselves is so everything in in Dynamics is driven by company uh billing um and everything pretty much in HubSpot's driven by contact and shipping. So that's where we're going to have to think through how do we combine how how do we merge the data? The origin is always big commerce. So we there should be a unique identifier. Yeah. It's an email right now and that's where problem lies.
 
 
00:23:40
 
Mike Martin: It should be a unique identifier that is a customer ID. It should not be an email or a contact or anything that's going to constantly evolve or change. That's a mistake. It should be ran by some form of customer number. Um and even with that there should be a hierarchy within the customer numbers. You can make your customer numbers however you want. So if I decided that one, two was curleaf, then I've got a hund, you know, 200 stores or whatever after that that I know everything one, two is curleaf, one, two, one is cure leaf one. One, two, two is cure leaf two, one, two, three is curle leaf four. Um, and you can push that all the way out through all of your MSOs through your unique identifiers. Or you can just do them chronologically. Just throw them in, you know, customer one through 10,00. But in either case, in my opinion, that's the way it should be.
Mike Metoyer: So, so how we have it right now is that unique identifier is in the uh the URL up top.
 
 
00:24:38
 
Mike Metoyer: So, for instance, I'm on Guushi's account. uh their bastard account is 13621. So ultimately before we we do this integration with uh dynamics to HubSpot there is a field in HubSpot on this bottom I just added it big commerce customer ID number. So there has to be a workflow where we can get that number and plug it into here. So when we're doing our our our lookup or whatever for Dynamics and our HubSpot customers, it's an automatic match and and we don't have to worry about it. So ideally I would Yeah.
Mike Martin: Who who has this connector right now? Who has the most information on this connector? And whoever's running this connector right now for us is the person that can I mean that's just another addition. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: So based on this make web better, it looks like Danny um was the one that was kind of touching it um last, but this was a couple years ago. This was last year in 2024. So, um I'm not 100% sure.
Mike Martin: Danny, Zach, any input is is adding That field going to be a problem.
 
 
00:25:43
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah, we just uh Go ahead, Danny. But yeah, that's that's what the connection between HubSpot and BigCom is. That's what we use it. We got we have to look into it. So today we can
Daniel Bagaporo: So the thing about that is make web better has its own specific set of parameters that it looks for. I'm looking at its configurations and it looks like that maybe I can I can look around and see what is in there but customer ID sync doesn't seem to be part of its uh automations. For example, um, uh, Matoyer, the, uh, the that Juicy customer ID, what was it again?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, it is going to be 13621.
Daniel Bagaporo: Okay, let me see. So, I'm going to share my screen in just a second here and kind of just uh show you how customer information gets ported over. And I'm going to use Juicy as an example. One second. So what you see right now is kind of like where everything that we see off of make web better.
 
 
00:27:10
 
Daniel Bagaporo: This is how customers are getting synced. It looks like that there are some missing fields here. And I went to go and look at this one in particular. Uh for whatever reason, this is pretty much what shows up in that in that contacts information, right? So, it's not sure where it's reading all of this information, but it's definitely just based off of it's it looks like it's based off of just like the email address. That's where the contact gets sync because email address is common between the customer uh information, the order information and so on, right? to sync off of the uh company ID or the customer group ID. There are two ways about that. The 13621 is the is essentially kind of like what I keep labeling as the BTOC portion of it, but there's also this company ID down here pulled through API which is the B2B uh company ID. So in terms of what to sync from where there are multiple avenues that we can kind of pull that kind of information.
 
 
00:28:19
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Oh wait I let me present sorry. Right. So this is uh so this is the the contact uh the company ID from B TOC 13621 entered up here and the return information is being pulled from the B2B record or API record. So there there are the the one thing that we need to get straight is where are we going to start pulling this information from? Because uh as I explained to Kenan, the original connector was built with B2C in mind, but then we eventually moved on to upgrading to kind of like a B2B environment in Big Commerce. And yeah.
Mike Martin: Yep. We never redesigned it when we start.
Mike Metoyer: What what's what's that line ID uh on number 23? Is that BC uh group ID 1362 something?
Daniel Bagaporo: uh at the top here.
Mike Metoyer: No, it's line 23. 1362. That's interesting.
Daniel Bagaporo: 923. Oh, yeah.
Zach Ungerman: 1362. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: It's missing the one.
Daniel Bagaporo: Looks like that, huh? Let me see. Let me try pulling it up.
 
 
00:29:49
 
Mike Metoyer: And and if we need to do this as a whole group, that's totally cool. If if not, we can do this offline up the meeting just so we don't waste everybody's time.
Daniel Bagaporo: Right.
Mike Martin: And here's the thing. I I I think we probably do need to go offline, but again, my my whole goal of this, I don't want to take everyone's time. It's Friday. Everyone's got a lot of s*** to do. I just want to get some deadlines and some true expectations because what's happening for me is there's all of these projects that are all involved in this one thing that I've just explained to everybody. because they're all bottlenecked at this point. I feel like there's a lot of people going everything's on hold because Keenan wants two weeks and I need to make sure that that isn't the case. And if it is the case that we're doing everything we can in the background in lie of what he's doing and then if we're we've done all that then we're providing all the resources that are necessary to shut this two weeks down to three or four days.
 
 
00:30:45
 
Mike Martin: Okay. Have one more question. Matoyer, do you are you organizing based on HubSpot or any of your other data besides Dynamics um the hierarchy or all the different um delivery addresses for your chains that we can also cross reference
Mike Metoyer: Uh I personally don't have a spreadsheet but uh the best uh location to do that is the B2B app uh in Big Commerce uh because that's where we set parent child accounts and the junior senior buyers.
Mike Martin: Bill can help with that. Okay. Sounds good. Export. I'm wondering if we should do a overarching document that maps how we're uh data hygiene and the cadence of what we're doing. We're going to do this first. We're going to do this second. We're going to do this. Mike is doing it as far as the hierarchy goes. Um I we just and then the order of sequence. Yes. Because Yeah. We're going to have to review that. Yes. Right now I have I'm doing it by uh shipping address from Big Commerce, tying it to the account number and dynamics.
 
 
00:32:01
 
Mike Martin: Yeah. Then tying it back to the customer name and then region and kind of doing a reverse engineer to see if our information is right. What I think would help is that because there's a lot of information that's just in people's heads about customer hierarchies that we don't know that isn't mapped out in dynamics. If Mike, you or the sales team wanted to find out a way to create your own mockup of parent child relationships as far as we have that emerald intel. Perfect. That's 100% correct. Perfect. Then we use that to compare against mine and then we iterate those two and create a decision matrix on what is really the deciding factor. Is it the email shipping address or is it a mixture of both? Which one takes precedence over the other? Right. So what do we need to do to get that done? Uh well the Emerald Intel um did the parent child mapping so that's that's accurate. So and that's a that's a a pivot table spreadsheet.
 
 
00:33:01
 
Mike Martin: Have you seen that? Alex, is that what you shared with me uh last year? Something that Alex worked on.
Alex Mazzei: That that was the CSV. It's a CSV file, but it also has all the customers in the industry, not only their their uh and the the customers. So, it's like a master masterly of all of the parent child relationships based on their um mechanism that they use to identify which ones are parent and child.
Mike Martin: See, that's something we could use on the customer intake side where it's predictive in a sense where if we have a location that we didn't previously have, it would recommend the customer uh setup in dynamics.
Alex Mazzei: And the way I was looking at it was this is the closest
Mike Martin: So I'll take a look at that um distill it down to what our customers are and then do a onetoone match. All right.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, quick question for Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: So we work on that.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, do we have a HubSpot developer environment?
Mike Martin: Yes. I do not believe we do.
 
 
00:34:09
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Because from there, I can probably dig into HubSpot's API capabilities and kind of see what can be pulled from HubSpot and maybe we can find some connections that way.
Mike Martin: Um,
Alex Mazzei: I believe you have a sandbox with the account that you have that you're paying for with HubSpot.
Daniel Bagaporo: Well, maybe because I'm looking to get into its actual developer environment uh where it can like expose web hooks and API calls.
Alex Mazzei: Is that what you're asking?
Mike Martin: We don't have our phone.
Alex Mazzei: Stop. Look at the documentation.
Mike Martin: Yeah, but we don't have the credentials. There is docu There is API documentation for sure and Danny's probably looking at it, but we don't have a a dedicated environment for ourselves. I'm not aware of it anyways.
Daniel Bagaporo: Gotcha.
Mike Martin: All right. Um, so you're going to work on that. You got that Excel sheet. Yeah. Okay. So, you're going to work on that. You're going to meet with Stravo and you're going to get back.
 
 
00:35:08
 
Mike Martin: I need you to put something on the calendar for Monday or Tuesday. Right. So, we have action items there. Alex, can can you update me on this $80,000 or $80,000 this $80,000 part cleanup data cleanup that we were doing in in in HubSpot? I know we we had talked about it and and I don't know if we put any tools in place to kind of scrub it and consolidate. Um, but after talking to Mike here, it sounds like he's as good or if not better than I am in Excel, which means maybe we can have him work on some of that scrub if we haven't done it already. Um, can anyone, whether it's Alex or Matoyer, update me on where we're at with the HubSpot cleanup?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, I I haven't really seen seen too much.
Mike Martin: We haven't done anything.
Alex Mazzei: The only thing that I did was I took the Emerald Intel information and pinned it with the information that I got from the customer table from the dynamics and then once I was getting a confirmation from that I was going to move into if it made sense with the HubSpot and do the same approach but I have to break it down by state because the the information is too much to run with one one sweep.
 
 
00:36:26
 
Mike Martin: So these are the tentacles I'm talking about why it's why I wanted to have this.
Zach Ungerman: Oh, okay.
Mike Martin: So you're working on a project that he he can't move forward until you're done.
Zach Ungerman: So on on Phil by
Mike Martin: Okay. Right. So understanding that puts us in a place where I need you to help me prioritize his time where I get Alex what he needs so I can move this project forward. Okay. So he's going to work on that for you, Alex. He'll get that back to you. He'll put a timet on it after he looks at it. I'll have him send you an email on where we're at with that. Um you're going to set a meeting up. We'll meet again next week. I'm sorry I can't hear you.
Zach Ungerman: by scrub. Uh, do we are we talking about what Martin and the three of us have been talking about for a while? Data hygiene. Is that what we're talking about?
 
 
00:37:14
 
Zach Ungerman: Because we we kind of kind of we've been sitting here talking about data hygiene, but who's doing the data hygiene?
Mike Martin: Yes.
Zach Ungerman: Like, is that Mike?
Alex Mazzei: Hey,
Mike Martin: Literally what we just talked about.
Zach Ungerman: Okay.
Mike Martin: So Mike Mets has a template from Intel uh intelligence, whatever the hell that the third word party.
Zach Ungerman: Mike Mets. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Mike Martin: He's going to match that to his own records for the parent child. We're going to come up with the parent child relationships and through the parent child relationships, he's going to give that back to Alex. Alex is then going to use that as confirmed data and then scrub the rest of it and get rid of all the ones that shouldn't be there and give that back to us. At that point, someone has to then be in charge of uploading it back into HubSpot and getting the act the data loaded. So, who's going to do that? Jim. Sure. Okay. So, I'm on the same page and everyone else here understands. It's in Mike Mets's court right now. It's going to be passed to Alex. Alex then's going to get it to Kenan. Kenan's going to set a meeting on Monday to tell us what Strao said so we can shorten down our timeline and get back to our intel intelligence conversation and build that in. By next Wednesday, everybody should have a lot more clarity. Do I understand this right? Everybody out there, is that your understanding? Danny, Zack, Mike.
Zach Ungerman: Y yeah.
Mike Metoyer: Yep.
Mike Martin: All right, let's go after it, guys.
Mike Metoyer: The only thing I ask is The only thing I ask is before we do any imports uh to HubSpot uh just to verify with me or Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: Let's do it.
Mike Metoyer: But that's it.
Mike Martin: It's got to be done in sandbox and and we got to have a HubSpot sandbox. I don't want to f*** everything up worse than we already have.
Mike Metoyer: Go.
Mike Martin: All right. Anything else?
Daniel Bagaporo: No.

Hubspot and parent child clean up update  - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Mike Metoyer: What up, Alex? I'm good, brother. How you doing?
Alex Mazzei: What's going on?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, as far as uh far as what?
Alex Mazzei: I'm all right. You guys get anywhere like any updates on like things that are moving forward.
Mike Metoyer: Um, so I kind of I haven't really been touching too many IT projects to be honest with you, so I I can't necessarily answer that. I know um HubSpot, I don't know if Zach was involved, but uh Kenan um and IT team I'm assuming um decided to put a little pause on the uh HubSpot project just due to uh cleaning up some uh company records and contacts because he was telling me in Dynamics he might have to create new or different forms to actually plug into Sky Villa um if we even go that route. He was like I was looking at a couple other options too. So, I'm not sure on uh on that piece, but yeah, we can hear a little more from him, but uh I did have something that I I did want to show you and and I could wait uh just to show you before we Yeah.
 
 
00:04:33
 
Mike Metoyer: So, everybody's in the call and they can see what I'm talking about. But, uh as we're cleaning up uh HubSpot just to match dynamics, just some of that data. Uh I actually looked into some of the fields. Um and there's actually a field called Big Commerce customer ID. Um, and so I guess before we we do make this transition to make web better, I was going to see if we could use that uh that middleware software or whatever to actually plug in the Big Commerce ID
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Mike Metoyer: number from the customer um into into HubSpot. I I don't know um if it's an option. Uh I just yeah was playing around with it and wanted to see.
Alex Mazzei: How you doing, Z?
Zach Ungerman: I'm doing well.
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Zach Ungerman: So, just Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, there's a few more people on the meeting, right?
Mike Metoyer: You uh you
Alex Mazzei: So, I I didn't want to go into too much details until we had everybody that were supposed to be on this main.
 
 
00:05:32
 
Alex Mazzei: It was like seven or eight people.
Mike Metoyer: There's a lot of people for sure.
Zach Ungerman: So, most of them are in the office. So, just wait for them to log on before we continue.
Mike Metoyer: Alex, you back home. Where you at? Damn. Okay. Jeez. Hopefully you're getting some good food out there, too.
Mike Martin: It's just Alex is join us. Looks like everybody. How are we doing?
Mike Metoyer: What's up? Good. How you guys doing?
Mike Martin: Good, good, good. How are you?
Zach Ungerman: Good.
Mike Metoyer: Good.
Mike Martin: Look at all those handsome faces, man. Good looking group.
Alex Mazzei: What's up, guys? I'm I'm in transition and there's like spotty uh cellular some.
Mike Martin: All right. Where what city are you in now, Alex?
Alex Mazzei: I don't know. It's Claremont for Mont. I don't know where the hell I am. New Hampshire.
Mike Martin: New Hampshire. All right. All right, guys.
 
 
00:08:28
 
Mike Martin: Well, I don't want to take everyone's time. This is a quick just update for everybody just to make sure we're all on the same page. We've got uh a bunch of things that are all pending each other is the way I'm going to describe it. So, we've got our HubSpot thing that we're dealing with. We have our middleware that we're dealing with. We have um the data cleanup process with the 80,000 uh entries that we've got to clean up. So, with with all of these things that we currently have in the air that are kind of all pending on this particular project, there has been a request from Kenan to to hold off for a little bit. so he can, you know, get some data cleaned up in the system. One of the things because Kenan is new, I want to make sure that everybody here understands holdups and pauses at this point in our project, I want defined and I want him to have all the resources he needs to limit that time. So when I hear two weeks of data, it scares the s*** out of me.
 
 
00:09:29
 
Mike Martin: I want to know what we're doing because you know an analogy that Matoyer gave me I think kind of rings true. We have plumbing and then we've got the water flow that goes in the plumbing and we do need to get this third party company building this out and part of that needs to I think happen at the same time that we're cleaning the data. And so because I'm hearing bits of information from Kenan, a little bit of information from Alex, little bit of information from Mike, I really want to close this gap here today and understand where we are. What are our true deadlines? Are we still on track to hit what we're we've all been talking about, which is 91, and have some true measurement here. Um, and with that, I'll open up the floor to anybody who wants to jump in and either correct me, set me straight, or or tell me everything I just said is accurate and give me some dates.
Alex Mazzei: Is is and Mike Mets with you?
Mike Martin: Mike Mets was invited to this meeting.
 
 
00:10:31
 
Mike Martin: I know he's on the meeting. He's not here, though. He was there. Uh, let me go grab him. I'll go walk over and grab him. I'll be right back. just uh kind of where I'm sitting at.
Alex Mazzei: Thank you.
Mike Martin: We have a meeting with Strawos today on how to better organize the parent child relationship in the system. Currently, we have all the data. It's in the system. However, when sales orders get created in Big Commerce with delivery addresses, those delivery addresses don't live on the customer record themselves. They just live on the sales orders. So, we need that data on um like new sales orders, new delivery addresses to be also applied to the customer record itself. So we have all the data sitting in one place. That's something Diana's and Mike are dealing with too. They're pulling we're pulling the customer data from Dynamics but all the addresses are not there. So we're to manipulate the delivery addresses to kind of uh link them to the correct parent account.
 
 
00:11:19
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah,
Mike Martin: The what's considered the parent account is the invoice account. Uh so that's the top level of it. So assuming that we think there's lower levels to that then we then we can reorganize the the delivery addresses to create chains. Um because right now the current way that we organize it through dynamics it's it's actually like a marketing module but it's it's a manual thing that we have to manually create the chain and all that. It's not efficient. The field is there but it's in the marketing section of the customer record. Got it. But I mean it's it it can live there. That's fine. And we just have to to ident correctly identify each of the company chains to make sure all the MSOs have all of their children underneath that chain. So we have the parent address which is the billing address and then we have the child addresses which are going to be delivery addresses shipping addresses.
Alex Mazzei: Was the the information from Emerald Intel able to help you at all, Kenan?
 
 
00:12:34
 
Mike Martin: We did not even cross check it with that. I mean that that data is important but it's it's all national, you know, that that's kind of encompassing everybody like people that we don't even serve. Um I mean it could be helpful for sales for sure. Um but we haven't cross- checked it. That that is something we can do whenever we we do our final audit. Um, that could be helpful in doing the USPS address format as well. Yep.
Mike Metoyer: So
Alex Mazzei: So basically what I'm hearing is you have the data that you're able to collect and you have two different One addresses. is the the shipping and one is the billing address. And you're using that information as the parent child relationship to set this up as a initial master sheet or master list.
Mike Martin: Right. In dynamics. Yep.
Alex Mazzei: And how confident are you everything that you need like and you're moving in the direction you need? Like what what support or help do you need from us?
 
 
00:13:30
 
Mike Martin: pretty confident because every pretty confident because every every address that comes from Big Commerce is a shipping address.
Alex Mazzei: Okay.
Mike Martin: They don't even denote billing address on their right. um that we did find billing addresses and the only reason I say this is because we found like a good bunch of PO addresses and we don't ship to PO so I'm assuming but those those addresses they might
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, you do have the billing
Mike Martin: but do those those billing addresses don't come over in the integration right so anything that is in Dynamics I can't understand is a shipping address in theory unless they mistakenly put their invoice address as a shipping address, which could happen, I guess. All right, guys. We're back.
Mike Metoyer: Well, and and Kenan, even with that, I would say the customers that do have a billing address, I would say less than 5% of our records, if that, actually use that billing address. Um, most people just use the shipping.
Mike Martin: We're invoicing. Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Uh yeah, for for uh like yeah, like our customers for invoicing.
 
 
00:14:36
 
Mike Martin: Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Yes. Um for sure. Uh specifically because we're not we're not in the 90s anymore where we're not hand mailing these invoices out. Um it's it's typically via email and so they want to actually see what shipping address that the invoice is tied to. Um,
Mike Martin: Gota way to the shipping address because that's what the invoice comes with. But that's what our customer prefers.
Mike Metoyer: So I guess I guess just touching on on So I I is.
Mike Martin: You can pay me and I can throw it in the trash if you want. I'm happy to do that. It'd be faster. But uh I wanted to uh point out that Mike is organizing our data that we pulled um through Big Commerce to kind of um simulate what we want to see in dynamics um pinpointing which ones would be the chains and which ones are their child accounts which are the delivery um addresses. And then the third part of that is creating like a region which as you know Mike like for example Curleaf likes their building per states um that's what we would consider a region but there's other MSOs's that handle their AP across different states but that's the the next step of that.
 
 
00:16:12
 
Mike Martin: So again, just just to recap, so I want to make sure because bringing Mike in, which I didn't have him in involved initially, but understanding he's working on parent child relationships, which kind of all ties into the HubSpot thing, which all ties into the middleware. So, I just want to get on the same page real quick with everybody and again close some dates off and make sure that we're not duplicating each other's work. And especially if he's put in enough time on this, we can run with what he has. Uh or vice versa, if someone else is already putting in time on this, we we just get together and collaborate. So, Alex, I know you had a question for Mike. That's why I went to go grab him. You want to jump back on?
Alex Mazzei: No, I just know that between what he was showing me in his office and some of the Google meets that we had of the data in his Excel spreadsheets, he had a lot of information organized. And I know Kenan and him were working together on that.
 
 
00:17:09
 
Alex Mazzei: And I just wanted him to be in this meeting because I feel like he has the ability that he's understanding what needs to happen, but he's also looking at the information. So when he's looking at it, he knows if it's right or wrong. and and I know Keenan has the back end of the ERP stuff as his skill set. So having both of those people in this meeting was paramount for me.
Mike Martin: So I mean everybody on the line here, everybody understands the parent child relationship. Everybody understands the middleware. Everybody understands what we're trying to get accomplished with dynamics, HubSpot, and Big Commerce. Is there anyone that's on the line that does not understand what we're trying to get accomplished? Then as we move forward, it's going to make sense because I need to know where we're at with timelines. When when's my next deadline? When what what's when's my next action item, deliverable? Where are we at? Meeting today with Straw Bus to review the best way to organize this data in Dynamics.
 
 
00:18:12
 
Mike Martin: Um once we have that methodology, then we can import the clean data that Mike has. Um we'll have to work on a import template for that. Um but once that's established, we should have correct hierarchy. We're also going to have to talk to strus about how we classify those uh regional operators and remove the tree. So I guess by the end of day we can probably have a good idea of how long the system will take based on what they tell us. I'd say so. Yeah. So then once they tell us that what's the next step? Organizing the data. um getting the data set up and in an import template that Kenan can use to upload to dynamics and then subsequent mail file and again I'm the idiot in the room speaking we're doing all this in sandbox. Yes. Right. Everybody understands we're doing all this in sandbox. Okay. So then when's an expectation that this will be done in sandbox, approved in sandbox that we can I can look forward to then moving forward with the other projects or can these other projects be moving simultaneously with this project?
 
 
00:19:18
 
Mike Martin: Right. Where we at with the middleware company? We I sent an email a couple days ago told and told them to hold off for at least a couple weeks. Okay. Why a couple weeks? Why not five days? Why not two days? Why not three days? Because I don't know what the timeline Strauss is going to give us. on or even if they have I don't even know if if they have the current um hierarchy relationship even in dynamics. I don't know they do. So okay. Yeah, it's there. So it could be five days. It could be two weeks. Okay. What what I'm going to say is we probably this meeting is probably premature understanding what I just found out. Probably need to have this meeting after you we have this meeting with Strao. So we're going to put this back on the calendar probably for Monday. That's okay with everybody else. Any other questions I need to understand what Mike?
 
 
00:20:06
 
Mike Martin: Go ahead.
Mike Metoyer: Yeah. So, uh I know you guys are you have a huge focus on uh Dynamics, which obviously that's going to be our source of truth. Uh when we're actually porting it over to HubSpot, um you know, originally uh they uh Instrumental Group was going to use the domain name as far as like uh connecting the accounts um and emails. Um I don't know if that's going to be the best way. So, I I was playing around in HubSpot and there is actually a field where you can input a Bitcommerce customer ID number. Um, and so with that, I don't know if we could uh create a workflow or have Make Web Better import that information from Big Commerce uh before we shut it off just so it's an easy match. Um, but yeah, I just wanted to ask you guys on that. It looks like Danny um is in charge of the workflows on that side.
Mike Martin: So once once an order is created in Big Commerce, it gets pushed to both Dynamics and HubSpot.
 
 
00:21:01
 
Mike Martin: That has to have a unique identifier that that's the same across both platforms, right? So that's the field that you're trying to put into HubSpot. Mike, that unique identifier, how's it being read right now, Mike?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, it's essentially uh Yeah.
Mike Martin: email.
Mike Metoyer: Uh I I don't know. Uh that's a question for Mike Martin. I think he has it uh based on email, the contacts.
Mike Martin: Yeah. Yeah. So uh the the flow goes uh email which goes uh which is a contact and um HubSpot automatically generates uh the primary company associated with the contact as long as it's uh a URL that's readable. So, if it's Mike M at Gmail, then it wouldn't create a uh company associated with Mike Martin because it's a Gmail account. So, there are some scenarios like that in HubSpot, but for the most part, that's how it's set up currently where it's automated by URL uh on the email. How how confident do you guys feel about the organization of the companies in in HubSpot where we can reference that as far as like okay so this company belongs to this chain HubSpot I feel we haven't done a
 
 
00:22:21
 
Mike Metoyer: I don't think we should go that route, but what do you what do you think, Martin?
Mike Martin: lot of hygiene anything that's been done has been automated that's probably going to be accurate but when it's um there are some situations where there's secondary tertiary level like Schwaz is a good example where it's not smart enough to read that and then we've been some people have been doing it by hand where they they have uh uh star buds and then they show primary is schwaz secondary is emeralds fields and they've been kind of just uh dragging and dropping that. So the question we have to ask ourselves is so everything in in Dynamics is driven by company uh billing um and everything pretty much in HubSpot's driven by contact and shipping. So that's where we're going to have to think through how do we combine how how do we merge the data? The origin is always big commerce. So we there should be a unique identifier. Yeah. It's an email right now and that's where problem lies.
 
 
00:23:40
 
Mike Martin: It should be a unique identifier that is a customer ID. It should not be an email or a contact or anything that's going to constantly evolve or change. That's a mistake. It should be ran by some form of customer number. Um and even with that there should be a hierarchy within the customer numbers. You can make your customer numbers however you want. So if I decided that one, two was curleaf, then I've got a hund, you know, 200 stores or whatever after that that I know everything one, two is curleaf, one, two, one is cure leaf one. One, two, two is cure leaf two, one, two, three is curle leaf four. Um, and you can push that all the way out through all of your MSOs through your unique identifiers. Or you can just do them chronologically. Just throw them in, you know, customer one through 10,00. But in either case, in my opinion, that's the way it should be.
Mike Metoyer: So, so how we have it right now is that unique identifier is in the uh the URL up top.
 
 
00:24:38
 
Mike Metoyer: So, for instance, I'm on Guushi's account. uh their bastard account is 13621. So ultimately before we we do this integration with uh dynamics to HubSpot there is a field in HubSpot on this bottom I just added it big commerce customer ID number. So there has to be a workflow where we can get that number and plug it into here. So when we're doing our our our lookup or whatever for Dynamics and our HubSpot customers, it's an automatic match and and we don't have to worry about it. So ideally I would Yeah.
Mike Martin: Who who has this connector right now? Who has the most information on this connector? And whoever's running this connector right now for us is the person that can I mean that's just another addition. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: So based on this make web better, it looks like Danny um was the one that was kind of touching it um last, but this was a couple years ago. This was last year in 2024. So, um I'm not 100% sure.
Mike Martin: Danny, Zach, any input is is adding That field going to be a problem.
 
 
00:25:43
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah, we just uh Go ahead, Danny. But yeah, that's that's what the connection between HubSpot and BigCom is. That's what we use it. We got we have to look into it. So today we can
Daniel Bagaporo: So the thing about that is make web better has its own specific set of parameters that it looks for. I'm looking at its configurations and it looks like that maybe I can I can look around and see what is in there but customer ID sync doesn't seem to be part of its uh automations. For example, um, uh, Matoyer, the, uh, the that Juicy customer ID, what was it again?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, it is going to be 13621.
Daniel Bagaporo: Okay, let me see. So, I'm going to share my screen in just a second here and kind of just uh show you how customer information gets ported over. And I'm going to use Juicy as an example. One second. So what you see right now is kind of like where everything that we see off of make web better.
 
 
00:27:10
 
Daniel Bagaporo: This is how customers are getting synced. It looks like that there are some missing fields here. And I went to go and look at this one in particular. Uh for whatever reason, this is pretty much what shows up in that in that contacts information, right? So, it's not sure where it's reading all of this information, but it's definitely just based off of it's it looks like it's based off of just like the email address. That's where the contact gets sync because email address is common between the customer uh information, the order information and so on, right? to sync off of the uh company ID or the customer group ID. There are two ways about that. The 13621 is the is essentially kind of like what I keep labeling as the BTOC portion of it, but there's also this company ID down here pulled through API which is the B2B uh company ID. So in terms of what to sync from where there are multiple avenues that we can kind of pull that kind of information.
 
 
00:28:19
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Oh wait I let me present sorry. Right. So this is uh so this is the the contact uh the company ID from B TOC 13621 entered up here and the return information is being pulled from the B2B record or API record. So there there are the the one thing that we need to get straight is where are we going to start pulling this information from? Because uh as I explained to Kenan, the original connector was built with B2C in mind, but then we eventually moved on to upgrading to kind of like a B2B environment in Big Commerce. And yeah.
Mike Martin: Yep. We never redesigned it when we start.
Mike Metoyer: What what's what's that line ID uh on number 23? Is that BC uh group ID 1362 something?
Daniel Bagaporo: uh at the top here.
Mike Metoyer: No, it's line 23. 1362. That's interesting.
Daniel Bagaporo: 923. Oh, yeah.
Zach Ungerman: 1362. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: It's missing the one.
Daniel Bagaporo: Looks like that, huh? Let me see. Let me try pulling it up.
 
 
00:29:49
 
Mike Metoyer: And and if we need to do this as a whole group, that's totally cool. If if not, we can do this offline up the meeting just so we don't waste everybody's time.
Daniel Bagaporo: Right.
Mike Martin: And here's the thing. I I I think we probably do need to go offline, but again, my my whole goal of this, I don't want to take everyone's time. It's Friday. Everyone's got a lot of s*** to do. I just want to get some deadlines and some true expectations because what's happening for me is there's all of these projects that are all involved in this one thing that I've just explained to everybody. because they're all bottlenecked at this point. I feel like there's a lot of people going everything's on hold because Keenan wants two weeks and I need to make sure that that isn't the case. And if it is the case that we're doing everything we can in the background in lie of what he's doing and then if we're we've done all that then we're providing all the resources that are necessary to shut this two weeks down to three or four days.
 
 
00:30:45
 
Mike Martin: Okay. Have one more question. Matoyer, do you are you organizing based on HubSpot or any of your other data besides Dynamics um the hierarchy or all the different um delivery addresses for your chains that we can also cross reference
Mike Metoyer: Uh I personally don't have a spreadsheet but uh the best uh location to do that is the B2B app uh in Big Commerce uh because that's where we set parent child accounts and the junior senior buyers.
Mike Martin: Bill can help with that. Okay. Sounds good. Export. I'm wondering if we should do a overarching document that maps how we're uh data hygiene and the cadence of what we're doing. We're going to do this first. We're going to do this second. We're going to do this. Mike is doing it as far as the hierarchy goes. Um I we just and then the order of sequence. Yes. Because Yeah. We're going to have to review that. Yes. Right now I have I'm doing it by uh shipping address from Big Commerce, tying it to the account number and dynamics.
 
 
00:32:01
 
Mike Martin: Yeah. Then tying it back to the customer name and then region and kind of doing a reverse engineer to see if our information is right. What I think would help is that because there's a lot of information that's just in people's heads about customer hierarchies that we don't know that isn't mapped out in dynamics. If Mike, you or the sales team wanted to find out a way to create your own mockup of parent child relationships as far as we have that emerald intel. Perfect. That's 100% correct. Perfect. Then we use that to compare against mine and then we iterate those two and create a decision matrix on what is really the deciding factor. Is it the email shipping address or is it a mixture of both? Which one takes precedence over the other? Right. So what do we need to do to get that done? Uh well the Emerald Intel um did the parent child mapping so that's that's accurate. So and that's a that's a a pivot table spreadsheet.
 
 
00:33:01
 
Mike Martin: Have you seen that? Alex, is that what you shared with me uh last year? Something that Alex worked on.
Alex Mazzei: That that was the CSV. It's a CSV file, but it also has all the customers in the industry, not only their their uh and the the customers. So, it's like a master masterly of all of the parent child relationships based on their um mechanism that they use to identify which ones are parent and child.
Mike Martin: See, that's something we could use on the customer intake side where it's predictive in a sense where if we have a location that we didn't previously have, it would recommend the customer uh setup in dynamics.
Alex Mazzei: And the way I was looking at it was this is the closest
Mike Martin: So I'll take a look at that um distill it down to what our customers are and then do a onetoone match. All right.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, quick question for Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: So we work on that.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, do we have a HubSpot developer environment?
Mike Martin: Yes. I do not believe we do.
 
 
00:34:09
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Because from there, I can probably dig into HubSpot's API capabilities and kind of see what can be pulled from HubSpot and maybe we can find some connections that way.
Mike Martin: Um,
Alex Mazzei: I believe you have a sandbox with the account that you have that you're paying for with HubSpot.
Daniel Bagaporo: Well, maybe because I'm looking to get into its actual developer environment uh where it can like expose web hooks and API calls.
Alex Mazzei: Is that what you're asking?
Mike Martin: We don't have our phone.
Alex Mazzei: Stop. Look at the documentation.
Mike Martin: Yeah, but we don't have the credentials. There is docu There is API documentation for sure and Danny's probably looking at it, but we don't have a a dedicated environment for ourselves. I'm not aware of it anyways.
Daniel Bagaporo: Gotcha.
Mike Martin: All right. Um, so you're going to work on that. You got that Excel sheet. Yeah. Okay. So, you're going to work on that. You're going to meet with Stravo and you're going to get back.
 
 
00:35:08
 
Mike Martin: I need you to put something on the calendar for Monday or Tuesday. Right. So, we have action items there. Alex, can can you update me on this $80,000 or $80,000 this $80,000 part cleanup data cleanup that we were doing in in in HubSpot? I know we we had talked about it and and I don't know if we put any tools in place to kind of scrub it and consolidate. Um, but after talking to Mike here, it sounds like he's as good or if not better than I am in Excel, which means maybe we can have him work on some of that scrub if we haven't done it already. Um, can anyone, whether it's Alex or Matoyer, update me on where we're at with the HubSpot cleanup?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, I I haven't really seen seen too much.
Mike Martin: We haven't done anything.
Alex Mazzei: The only thing that I did was I took the Emerald Intel information and pinned it with the information that I got from the customer table from the dynamics and then once I was getting a confirmation from that I was going to move into if it made sense with the HubSpot and do the same approach but I have to break it down by state because the the information is too much to run with one one sweep.
 
 
00:36:26
 
Mike Martin: So these are the tentacles I'm talking about why it's why I wanted to have this.
Zach Ungerman: Oh, okay.
Mike Martin: So you're working on a project that he he can't move forward until you're done.
Zach Ungerman: So on on Phil by
Mike Martin: Okay. Right. So understanding that puts us in a place where I need you to help me prioritize his time where I get Alex what he needs so I can move this project forward. Okay. So he's going to work on that for you, Alex. He'll get that back to you. He'll put a timet on it after he looks at it. I'll have him send you an email on where we're at with that. Um you're going to set a meeting up. We'll meet again next week. I'm sorry I can't hear you.
Zach Ungerman: by scrub. Uh, do we are we talking about what Martin and the three of us have been talking about for a while? Data hygiene. Is that what we're talking about?
 
 
00:37:14
 
Zach Ungerman: Because we we kind of kind of we've been sitting here talking about data hygiene, but who's doing the data hygiene?
Mike Martin: Yes.
Zach Ungerman: Like, is that Mike?
Alex Mazzei: Hey,
Mike Martin: Literally what we just talked about.
Zach Ungerman: Okay.
Mike Martin: So Mike Mets has a template from Intel uh intelligence, whatever the hell that the third word party.
Zach Ungerman: Mike Mets. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Mike Martin: He's going to match that to his own records for the parent child. We're going to come up with the parent child relationships and through the parent child relationships, he's going to give that back to Alex. Alex is then going to use that as confirmed data and then scrub the rest of it and get rid of all the ones that shouldn't be there and give that back to us. At that point, someone has to then be in charge of uploading it back into HubSpot and getting the act the data loaded. So, who's going to do that? Jim. Sure. Okay. So, I'm on the same page and everyone else here understands. It's in Mike Mets's court right now. It's going to be passed to Alex. Alex then's going to get it to Kenan. Kenan's going to set a meeting on Monday to tell us what Strao said so we can shorten down our timeline and get back to our intel intelligence conversation and build that in. By next Wednesday, everybody should have a lot more clarity. Do I understand this right? Everybody out there, is that your understanding? Danny, Zack, Mike.
Zach Ungerman: Y yeah.
Mike Metoyer: Yep.
Mike Martin: All right, let's go after it, guys.
Mike Metoyer: The only thing I ask is The only thing I ask is before we do any imports uh to HubSpot uh just to verify with me or Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: Let's do it.
Mike Metoyer: But that's it.
Mike Martin: It's got to be done in sandbox and and we got to have a HubSpot sandbox. I don't want to f*** everything up worse than we already have.
Mike Metoyer: Go.
Mike Martin: All right. Anything else?
Daniel Bagaporo: No.

Hubspot and parent child clean up update  - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Mike Metoyer: What up, Alex? I'm good, brother. How you doing?
Alex Mazzei: What's going on?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, as far as uh far as what?
Alex Mazzei: I'm all right. You guys get anywhere like any updates on like things that are moving forward.
Mike Metoyer: Um, so I kind of I haven't really been touching too many IT projects to be honest with you, so I I can't necessarily answer that. I know um HubSpot, I don't know if Zach was involved, but uh Kenan um and IT team I'm assuming um decided to put a little pause on the uh HubSpot project just due to uh cleaning up some uh company records and contacts because he was telling me in Dynamics he might have to create new or different forms to actually plug into Sky Villa um if we even go that route. He was like I was looking at a couple other options too. So, I'm not sure on uh on that piece, but yeah, we can hear a little more from him, but uh I did have something that I I did want to show you and and I could wait uh just to show you before we Yeah.
 
 
00:04:33
 
Mike Metoyer: So, everybody's in the call and they can see what I'm talking about. But, uh as we're cleaning up uh HubSpot just to match dynamics, just some of that data. Uh I actually looked into some of the fields. Um and there's actually a field called Big Commerce customer ID. Um, and so I guess before we we do make this transition to make web better, I was going to see if we could use that uh that middleware software or whatever to actually plug in the Big Commerce ID
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Mike Metoyer: number from the customer um into into HubSpot. I I don't know um if it's an option. Uh I just yeah was playing around with it and wanted to see.
Alex Mazzei: How you doing, Z?
Zach Ungerman: I'm doing well.
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Zach Ungerman: So, just Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, there's a few more people on the meeting, right?
Mike Metoyer: You uh you
Alex Mazzei: So, I I didn't want to go into too much details until we had everybody that were supposed to be on this main.
 
 
00:05:32
 
Alex Mazzei: It was like seven or eight people.
Mike Metoyer: There's a lot of people for sure.
Zach Ungerman: So, most of them are in the office. So, just wait for them to log on before we continue.
Mike Metoyer: Alex, you back home. Where you at? Damn. Okay. Jeez. Hopefully you're getting some good food out there, too.
Mike Martin: It's just Alex is join us. Looks like everybody. How are we doing?
Mike Metoyer: What's up? Good. How you guys doing?
Mike Martin: Good, good, good. How are you?
Zach Ungerman: Good.
Mike Metoyer: Good.
Mike Martin: Look at all those handsome faces, man. Good looking group.
Alex Mazzei: What's up, guys? I'm I'm in transition and there's like spotty uh cellular some.
Mike Martin: All right. Where what city are you in now, Alex?
Alex Mazzei: I don't know. It's Claremont for Mont. I don't know where the hell I am. New Hampshire.
Mike Martin: New Hampshire. All right. All right, guys.
 
 
00:08:28
 
Mike Martin: Well, I don't want to take everyone's time. This is a quick just update for everybody just to make sure we're all on the same page. We've got uh a bunch of things that are all pending each other is the way I'm going to describe it. So, we've got our HubSpot thing that we're dealing with. We have our middleware that we're dealing with. We have um the data cleanup process with the 80,000 uh entries that we've got to clean up. So, with with all of these things that we currently have in the air that are kind of all pending on this particular project, there has been a request from Kenan to to hold off for a little bit. so he can, you know, get some data cleaned up in the system. One of the things because Kenan is new, I want to make sure that everybody here understands holdups and pauses at this point in our project, I want defined and I want him to have all the resources he needs to limit that time. So when I hear two weeks of data, it scares the s*** out of me.
 
 
00:09:29
 
Mike Martin: I want to know what we're doing because you know an analogy that Matoyer gave me I think kind of rings true. We have plumbing and then we've got the water flow that goes in the plumbing and we do need to get this third party company building this out and part of that needs to I think happen at the same time that we're cleaning the data. And so because I'm hearing bits of information from Kenan, a little bit of information from Alex, little bit of information from Mike, I really want to close this gap here today and understand where we are. What are our true deadlines? Are we still on track to hit what we're we've all been talking about, which is 91, and have some true measurement here. Um, and with that, I'll open up the floor to anybody who wants to jump in and either correct me, set me straight, or or tell me everything I just said is accurate and give me some dates.
Alex Mazzei: Is is and Mike Mets with you?
Mike Martin: Mike Mets was invited to this meeting.
 
 
00:10:31
 
Mike Martin: I know he's on the meeting. He's not here, though. He was there. Uh, let me go grab him. I'll go walk over and grab him. I'll be right back. just uh kind of where I'm sitting at.
Alex Mazzei: Thank you.
Mike Martin: We have a meeting with Strawos today on how to better organize the parent child relationship in the system. Currently, we have all the data. It's in the system. However, when sales orders get created in Big Commerce with delivery addresses, those delivery addresses don't live on the customer record themselves. They just live on the sales orders. So, we need that data on um like new sales orders, new delivery addresses to be also applied to the customer record itself. So we have all the data sitting in one place. That's something Diana's and Mike are dealing with too. They're pulling we're pulling the customer data from Dynamics but all the addresses are not there. So we're to manipulate the delivery addresses to kind of uh link them to the correct parent account.
 
 
00:11:19
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah,
Mike Martin: The what's considered the parent account is the invoice account. Uh so that's the top level of it. So assuming that we think there's lower levels to that then we then we can reorganize the the delivery addresses to create chains. Um because right now the current way that we organize it through dynamics it's it's actually like a marketing module but it's it's a manual thing that we have to manually create the chain and all that. It's not efficient. The field is there but it's in the marketing section of the customer record. Got it. But I mean it's it it can live there. That's fine. And we just have to to ident correctly identify each of the company chains to make sure all the MSOs have all of their children underneath that chain. So we have the parent address which is the billing address and then we have the child addresses which are going to be delivery addresses shipping addresses.
Alex Mazzei: Was the the information from Emerald Intel able to help you at all, Kenan?
 
 
00:12:34
 
Mike Martin: We did not even cross check it with that. I mean that that data is important but it's it's all national, you know, that that's kind of encompassing everybody like people that we don't even serve. Um I mean it could be helpful for sales for sure. Um but we haven't cross- checked it. That that is something we can do whenever we we do our final audit. Um, that could be helpful in doing the USPS address format as well. Yep.
Mike Metoyer: So
Alex Mazzei: So basically what I'm hearing is you have the data that you're able to collect and you have two different One addresses. is the the shipping and one is the billing address. And you're using that information as the parent child relationship to set this up as a initial master sheet or master list.
Mike Martin: Right. In dynamics. Yep.
Alex Mazzei: And how confident are you everything that you need like and you're moving in the direction you need? Like what what support or help do you need from us?
 
 
00:13:30
 
Mike Martin: pretty confident because every pretty confident because every every address that comes from Big Commerce is a shipping address.
Alex Mazzei: Okay.
Mike Martin: They don't even denote billing address on their right. um that we did find billing addresses and the only reason I say this is because we found like a good bunch of PO addresses and we don't ship to PO so I'm assuming but those those addresses they might
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, you do have the billing
Mike Martin: but do those those billing addresses don't come over in the integration right so anything that is in Dynamics I can't understand is a shipping address in theory unless they mistakenly put their invoice address as a shipping address, which could happen, I guess. All right, guys. We're back.
Mike Metoyer: Well, and and Kenan, even with that, I would say the customers that do have a billing address, I would say less than 5% of our records, if that, actually use that billing address. Um, most people just use the shipping.
Mike Martin: We're invoicing. Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Uh yeah, for for uh like yeah, like our customers for invoicing.
 
 
00:14:36
 
Mike Martin: Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Yes. Um for sure. Uh specifically because we're not we're not in the 90s anymore where we're not hand mailing these invoices out. Um it's it's typically via email and so they want to actually see what shipping address that the invoice is tied to. Um,
Mike Martin: Gota way to the shipping address because that's what the invoice comes with. But that's what our customer prefers.
Mike Metoyer: So I guess I guess just touching on on So I I is.
Mike Martin: You can pay me and I can throw it in the trash if you want. I'm happy to do that. It'd be faster. But uh I wanted to uh point out that Mike is organizing our data that we pulled um through Big Commerce to kind of um simulate what we want to see in dynamics um pinpointing which ones would be the chains and which ones are their child accounts which are the delivery um addresses. And then the third part of that is creating like a region which as you know Mike like for example Curleaf likes their building per states um that's what we would consider a region but there's other MSOs's that handle their AP across different states but that's the the next step of that.
 
 
00:16:12
 
Mike Martin: So again, just just to recap, so I want to make sure because bringing Mike in, which I didn't have him in involved initially, but understanding he's working on parent child relationships, which kind of all ties into the HubSpot thing, which all ties into the middleware. So, I just want to get on the same page real quick with everybody and again close some dates off and make sure that we're not duplicating each other's work. And especially if he's put in enough time on this, we can run with what he has. Uh or vice versa, if someone else is already putting in time on this, we we just get together and collaborate. So, Alex, I know you had a question for Mike. That's why I went to go grab him. You want to jump back on?
Alex Mazzei: No, I just know that between what he was showing me in his office and some of the Google meets that we had of the data in his Excel spreadsheets, he had a lot of information organized. And I know Kenan and him were working together on that.
 
 
00:17:09
 
Alex Mazzei: And I just wanted him to be in this meeting because I feel like he has the ability that he's understanding what needs to happen, but he's also looking at the information. So when he's looking at it, he knows if it's right or wrong. and and I know Keenan has the back end of the ERP stuff as his skill set. So having both of those people in this meeting was paramount for me.
Mike Martin: So I mean everybody on the line here, everybody understands the parent child relationship. Everybody understands the middleware. Everybody understands what we're trying to get accomplished with dynamics, HubSpot, and Big Commerce. Is there anyone that's on the line that does not understand what we're trying to get accomplished? Then as we move forward, it's going to make sense because I need to know where we're at with timelines. When when's my next deadline? When what what's when's my next action item, deliverable? Where are we at? Meeting today with Straw Bus to review the best way to organize this data in Dynamics.
 
 
00:18:12
 
Mike Martin: Um once we have that methodology, then we can import the clean data that Mike has. Um we'll have to work on a import template for that. Um but once that's established, we should have correct hierarchy. We're also going to have to talk to strus about how we classify those uh regional operators and remove the tree. So I guess by the end of day we can probably have a good idea of how long the system will take based on what they tell us. I'd say so. Yeah. So then once they tell us that what's the next step? Organizing the data. um getting the data set up and in an import template that Kenan can use to upload to dynamics and then subsequent mail file and again I'm the idiot in the room speaking we're doing all this in sandbox. Yes. Right. Everybody understands we're doing all this in sandbox. Okay. So then when's an expectation that this will be done in sandbox, approved in sandbox that we can I can look forward to then moving forward with the other projects or can these other projects be moving simultaneously with this project?
 
 
00:19:18
 
Mike Martin: Right. Where we at with the middleware company? We I sent an email a couple days ago told and told them to hold off for at least a couple weeks. Okay. Why a couple weeks? Why not five days? Why not two days? Why not three days? Because I don't know what the timeline Strauss is going to give us. on or even if they have I don't even know if if they have the current um hierarchy relationship even in dynamics. I don't know they do. So okay. Yeah, it's there. So it could be five days. It could be two weeks. Okay. What what I'm going to say is we probably this meeting is probably premature understanding what I just found out. Probably need to have this meeting after you we have this meeting with Strao. So we're going to put this back on the calendar probably for Monday. That's okay with everybody else. Any other questions I need to understand what Mike?
 
 
00:20:06
 
Mike Martin: Go ahead.
Mike Metoyer: Yeah. So, uh I know you guys are you have a huge focus on uh Dynamics, which obviously that's going to be our source of truth. Uh when we're actually porting it over to HubSpot, um you know, originally uh they uh Instrumental Group was going to use the domain name as far as like uh connecting the accounts um and emails. Um I don't know if that's going to be the best way. So, I I was playing around in HubSpot and there is actually a field where you can input a Bitcommerce customer ID number. Um, and so with that, I don't know if we could uh create a workflow or have Make Web Better import that information from Big Commerce uh before we shut it off just so it's an easy match. Um, but yeah, I just wanted to ask you guys on that. It looks like Danny um is in charge of the workflows on that side.
Mike Martin: So once once an order is created in Big Commerce, it gets pushed to both Dynamics and HubSpot.
 
 
00:21:01
 
Mike Martin: That has to have a unique identifier that that's the same across both platforms, right? So that's the field that you're trying to put into HubSpot. Mike, that unique identifier, how's it being read right now, Mike?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, it's essentially uh Yeah.
Mike Martin: email.
Mike Metoyer: Uh I I don't know. Uh that's a question for Mike Martin. I think he has it uh based on email, the contacts.
Mike Martin: Yeah. Yeah. So uh the the flow goes uh email which goes uh which is a contact and um HubSpot automatically generates uh the primary company associated with the contact as long as it's uh a URL that's readable. So, if it's Mike M at Gmail, then it wouldn't create a uh company associated with Mike Martin because it's a Gmail account. So, there are some scenarios like that in HubSpot, but for the most part, that's how it's set up currently where it's automated by URL uh on the email. How how confident do you guys feel about the organization of the companies in in HubSpot where we can reference that as far as like okay so this company belongs to this chain HubSpot I feel we haven't done a
 
 
00:22:21
 
Mike Metoyer: I don't think we should go that route, but what do you what do you think, Martin?
Mike Martin: lot of hygiene anything that's been done has been automated that's probably going to be accurate but when it's um there are some situations where there's secondary tertiary level like Schwaz is a good example where it's not smart enough to read that and then we've been some people have been doing it by hand where they they have uh uh star buds and then they show primary is schwaz secondary is emeralds fields and they've been kind of just uh dragging and dropping that. So the question we have to ask ourselves is so everything in in Dynamics is driven by company uh billing um and everything pretty much in HubSpot's driven by contact and shipping. So that's where we're going to have to think through how do we combine how how do we merge the data? The origin is always big commerce. So we there should be a unique identifier. Yeah. It's an email right now and that's where problem lies.
 
 
00:23:40
 
Mike Martin: It should be a unique identifier that is a customer ID. It should not be an email or a contact or anything that's going to constantly evolve or change. That's a mistake. It should be ran by some form of customer number. Um and even with that there should be a hierarchy within the customer numbers. You can make your customer numbers however you want. So if I decided that one, two was curleaf, then I've got a hund, you know, 200 stores or whatever after that that I know everything one, two is curleaf, one, two, one is cure leaf one. One, two, two is cure leaf two, one, two, three is curle leaf four. Um, and you can push that all the way out through all of your MSOs through your unique identifiers. Or you can just do them chronologically. Just throw them in, you know, customer one through 10,00. But in either case, in my opinion, that's the way it should be.
Mike Metoyer: So, so how we have it right now is that unique identifier is in the uh the URL up top.
 
 
00:24:38
 
Mike Metoyer: So, for instance, I'm on Guushi's account. uh their bastard account is 13621. So ultimately before we we do this integration with uh dynamics to HubSpot there is a field in HubSpot on this bottom I just added it big commerce customer ID number. So there has to be a workflow where we can get that number and plug it into here. So when we're doing our our our lookup or whatever for Dynamics and our HubSpot customers, it's an automatic match and and we don't have to worry about it. So ideally I would Yeah.
Mike Martin: Who who has this connector right now? Who has the most information on this connector? And whoever's running this connector right now for us is the person that can I mean that's just another addition. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: So based on this make web better, it looks like Danny um was the one that was kind of touching it um last, but this was a couple years ago. This was last year in 2024. So, um I'm not 100% sure.
Mike Martin: Danny, Zach, any input is is adding That field going to be a problem.
 
 
00:25:43
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah, we just uh Go ahead, Danny. But yeah, that's that's what the connection between HubSpot and BigCom is. That's what we use it. We got we have to look into it. So today we can
Daniel Bagaporo: So the thing about that is make web better has its own specific set of parameters that it looks for. I'm looking at its configurations and it looks like that maybe I can I can look around and see what is in there but customer ID sync doesn't seem to be part of its uh automations. For example, um, uh, Matoyer, the, uh, the that Juicy customer ID, what was it again?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, it is going to be 13621.
Daniel Bagaporo: Okay, let me see. So, I'm going to share my screen in just a second here and kind of just uh show you how customer information gets ported over. And I'm going to use Juicy as an example. One second. So what you see right now is kind of like where everything that we see off of make web better.
 
 
00:27:10
 
Daniel Bagaporo: This is how customers are getting synced. It looks like that there are some missing fields here. And I went to go and look at this one in particular. Uh for whatever reason, this is pretty much what shows up in that in that contacts information, right? So, it's not sure where it's reading all of this information, but it's definitely just based off of it's it looks like it's based off of just like the email address. That's where the contact gets sync because email address is common between the customer uh information, the order information and so on, right? to sync off of the uh company ID or the customer group ID. There are two ways about that. The 13621 is the is essentially kind of like what I keep labeling as the BTOC portion of it, but there's also this company ID down here pulled through API which is the B2B uh company ID. So in terms of what to sync from where there are multiple avenues that we can kind of pull that kind of information.
 
 
00:28:19
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Oh wait I let me present sorry. Right. So this is uh so this is the the contact uh the company ID from B TOC 13621 entered up here and the return information is being pulled from the B2B record or API record. So there there are the the one thing that we need to get straight is where are we going to start pulling this information from? Because uh as I explained to Kenan, the original connector was built with B2C in mind, but then we eventually moved on to upgrading to kind of like a B2B environment in Big Commerce. And yeah.
Mike Martin: Yep. We never redesigned it when we start.
Mike Metoyer: What what's what's that line ID uh on number 23? Is that BC uh group ID 1362 something?
Daniel Bagaporo: uh at the top here.
Mike Metoyer: No, it's line 23. 1362. That's interesting.
Daniel Bagaporo: 923. Oh, yeah.
Zach Ungerman: 1362. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: It's missing the one.
Daniel Bagaporo: Looks like that, huh? Let me see. Let me try pulling it up.
 
 
00:29:49
 
Mike Metoyer: And and if we need to do this as a whole group, that's totally cool. If if not, we can do this offline up the meeting just so we don't waste everybody's time.
Daniel Bagaporo: Right.
Mike Martin: And here's the thing. I I I think we probably do need to go offline, but again, my my whole goal of this, I don't want to take everyone's time. It's Friday. Everyone's got a lot of s*** to do. I just want to get some deadlines and some true expectations because what's happening for me is there's all of these projects that are all involved in this one thing that I've just explained to everybody. because they're all bottlenecked at this point. I feel like there's a lot of people going everything's on hold because Keenan wants two weeks and I need to make sure that that isn't the case. And if it is the case that we're doing everything we can in the background in lie of what he's doing and then if we're we've done all that then we're providing all the resources that are necessary to shut this two weeks down to three or four days.
 
 
00:30:45
 
Mike Martin: Okay. Have one more question. Matoyer, do you are you organizing based on HubSpot or any of your other data besides Dynamics um the hierarchy or all the different um delivery addresses for your chains that we can also cross reference
Mike Metoyer: Uh I personally don't have a spreadsheet but uh the best uh location to do that is the B2B app uh in Big Commerce uh because that's where we set parent child accounts and the junior senior buyers.
Mike Martin: Bill can help with that. Okay. Sounds good. Export. I'm wondering if we should do a overarching document that maps how we're uh data hygiene and the cadence of what we're doing. We're going to do this first. We're going to do this second. We're going to do this. Mike is doing it as far as the hierarchy goes. Um I we just and then the order of sequence. Yes. Because Yeah. We're going to have to review that. Yes. Right now I have I'm doing it by uh shipping address from Big Commerce, tying it to the account number and dynamics.
 
 
00:32:01
 
Mike Martin: Yeah. Then tying it back to the customer name and then region and kind of doing a reverse engineer to see if our information is right. What I think would help is that because there's a lot of information that's just in people's heads about customer hierarchies that we don't know that isn't mapped out in dynamics. If Mike, you or the sales team wanted to find out a way to create your own mockup of parent child relationships as far as we have that emerald intel. Perfect. That's 100% correct. Perfect. Then we use that to compare against mine and then we iterate those two and create a decision matrix on what is really the deciding factor. Is it the email shipping address or is it a mixture of both? Which one takes precedence over the other? Right. So what do we need to do to get that done? Uh well the Emerald Intel um did the parent child mapping so that's that's accurate. So and that's a that's a a pivot table spreadsheet.
 
 
00:33:01
 
Mike Martin: Have you seen that? Alex, is that what you shared with me uh last year? Something that Alex worked on.
Alex Mazzei: That that was the CSV. It's a CSV file, but it also has all the customers in the industry, not only their their uh and the the customers. So, it's like a master masterly of all of the parent child relationships based on their um mechanism that they use to identify which ones are parent and child.
Mike Martin: See, that's something we could use on the customer intake side where it's predictive in a sense where if we have a location that we didn't previously have, it would recommend the customer uh setup in dynamics.
Alex Mazzei: And the way I was looking at it was this is the closest
Mike Martin: So I'll take a look at that um distill it down to what our customers are and then do a onetoone match. All right.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, quick question for Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: So we work on that.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, do we have a HubSpot developer environment?
Mike Martin: Yes. I do not believe we do.
 
 
00:34:09
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Because from there, I can probably dig into HubSpot's API capabilities and kind of see what can be pulled from HubSpot and maybe we can find some connections that way.
Mike Martin: Um,
Alex Mazzei: I believe you have a sandbox with the account that you have that you're paying for with HubSpot.
Daniel Bagaporo: Well, maybe because I'm looking to get into its actual developer environment uh where it can like expose web hooks and API calls.
Alex Mazzei: Is that what you're asking?
Mike Martin: We don't have our phone.
Alex Mazzei: Stop. Look at the documentation.
Mike Martin: Yeah, but we don't have the credentials. There is docu There is API documentation for sure and Danny's probably looking at it, but we don't have a a dedicated environment for ourselves. I'm not aware of it anyways.
Daniel Bagaporo: Gotcha.
Mike Martin: All right. Um, so you're going to work on that. You got that Excel sheet. Yeah. Okay. So, you're going to work on that. You're going to meet with Stravo and you're going to get back.
 
 
00:35:08
 
Mike Martin: I need you to put something on the calendar for Monday or Tuesday. Right. So, we have action items there. Alex, can can you update me on this $80,000 or $80,000 this $80,000 part cleanup data cleanup that we were doing in in in HubSpot? I know we we had talked about it and and I don't know if we put any tools in place to kind of scrub it and consolidate. Um, but after talking to Mike here, it sounds like he's as good or if not better than I am in Excel, which means maybe we can have him work on some of that scrub if we haven't done it already. Um, can anyone, whether it's Alex or Matoyer, update me on where we're at with the HubSpot cleanup?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, I I haven't really seen seen too much.
Mike Martin: We haven't done anything.
Alex Mazzei: The only thing that I did was I took the Emerald Intel information and pinned it with the information that I got from the customer table from the dynamics and then once I was getting a confirmation from that I was going to move into if it made sense with the HubSpot and do the same approach but I have to break it down by state because the the information is too much to run with one one sweep.
 
 
00:36:26
 
Mike Martin: So these are the tentacles I'm talking about why it's why I wanted to have this.
Zach Ungerman: Oh, okay.
Mike Martin: So you're working on a project that he he can't move forward until you're done.
Zach Ungerman: So on on Phil by
Mike Martin: Okay. Right. So understanding that puts us in a place where I need you to help me prioritize his time where I get Alex what he needs so I can move this project forward. Okay. So he's going to work on that for you, Alex. He'll get that back to you. He'll put a timet on it after he looks at it. I'll have him send you an email on where we're at with that. Um you're going to set a meeting up. We'll meet again next week. I'm sorry I can't hear you.
Zach Ungerman: by scrub. Uh, do we are we talking about what Martin and the three of us have been talking about for a while? Data hygiene. Is that what we're talking about?
 
 
00:37:14
 
Zach Ungerman: Because we we kind of kind of we've been sitting here talking about data hygiene, but who's doing the data hygiene?
Mike Martin: Yes.
Zach Ungerman: Like, is that Mike?
Alex Mazzei: Hey,
Mike Martin: Literally what we just talked about.
Zach Ungerman: Okay.
Mike Martin: So Mike Mets has a template from Intel uh intelligence, whatever the hell that the third word party.
Zach Ungerman: Mike Mets. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Mike Martin: He's going to match that to his own records for the parent child. We're going to come up with the parent child relationships and through the parent child relationships, he's going to give that back to Alex. Alex is then going to use that as confirmed data and then scrub the rest of it and get rid of all the ones that shouldn't be there and give that back to us. At that point, someone has to then be in charge of uploading it back into HubSpot and getting the act the data loaded. So, who's going to do that? Jim. Sure. Okay. So, I'm on the same page and everyone else here understands. It's in Mike Mets's court right now. It's going to be passed to Alex. Alex then's going to get it to Kenan. Kenan's going to set a meeting on Monday to tell us what Strao said so we can shorten down our timeline and get back to our intel intelligence conversation and build that in. By next Wednesday, everybody should have a lot more clarity. Do I understand this right? Everybody out there, is that your understanding? Danny, Zack, Mike.
Zach Ungerman: Y yeah.
Mike Metoyer: Yep.
Mike Martin: All right, let's go after it, guys.
Mike Metoyer: The only thing I ask is The only thing I ask is before we do any imports uh to HubSpot uh just to verify with me or Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: Let's do it.
Mike Metoyer: But that's it.
Mike Martin: It's got to be done in sandbox and and we got to have a HubSpot sandbox. I don't want to f*** everything up worse than we already have.
Mike Metoyer: Go.
Mike Martin: All right. Anything else?
Daniel Bagaporo: No.

Hubspot and parent child clean up update  - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Mike Metoyer: What up, Alex? I'm good, brother. How you doing?
Alex Mazzei: What's going on?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, as far as uh far as what?
Alex Mazzei: I'm all right. You guys get anywhere like any updates on like things that are moving forward.
Mike Metoyer: Um, so I kind of I haven't really been touching too many IT projects to be honest with you, so I I can't necessarily answer that. I know um HubSpot, I don't know if Zach was involved, but uh Kenan um and IT team I'm assuming um decided to put a little pause on the uh HubSpot project just due to uh cleaning up some uh company records and contacts because he was telling me in Dynamics he might have to create new or different forms to actually plug into Sky Villa um if we even go that route. He was like I was looking at a couple other options too. So, I'm not sure on uh on that piece, but yeah, we can hear a little more from him, but uh I did have something that I I did want to show you and and I could wait uh just to show you before we Yeah.
 
 
00:04:33
 
Mike Metoyer: So, everybody's in the call and they can see what I'm talking about. But, uh as we're cleaning up uh HubSpot just to match dynamics, just some of that data. Uh I actually looked into some of the fields. Um and there's actually a field called Big Commerce customer ID. Um, and so I guess before we we do make this transition to make web better, I was going to see if we could use that uh that middleware software or whatever to actually plug in the Big Commerce ID
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Mike Metoyer: number from the customer um into into HubSpot. I I don't know um if it's an option. Uh I just yeah was playing around with it and wanted to see.
Alex Mazzei: How you doing, Z?
Zach Ungerman: I'm doing well.
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Zach Ungerman: So, just Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, there's a few more people on the meeting, right?
Mike Metoyer: You uh you
Alex Mazzei: So, I I didn't want to go into too much details until we had everybody that were supposed to be on this main.
 
 
00:05:32
 
Alex Mazzei: It was like seven or eight people.
Mike Metoyer: There's a lot of people for sure.
Zach Ungerman: So, most of them are in the office. So, just wait for them to log on before we continue.
Mike Metoyer: Alex, you back home. Where you at? Damn. Okay. Jeez. Hopefully you're getting some good food out there, too.
Mike Martin: It's just Alex is join us. Looks like everybody. How are we doing?
Mike Metoyer: What's up? Good. How you guys doing?
Mike Martin: Good, good, good. How are you?
Zach Ungerman: Good.
Mike Metoyer: Good.
Mike Martin: Look at all those handsome faces, man. Good looking group.
Alex Mazzei: What's up, guys? I'm I'm in transition and there's like spotty uh cellular some.
Mike Martin: All right. Where what city are you in now, Alex?
Alex Mazzei: I don't know. It's Claremont for Mont. I don't know where the hell I am. New Hampshire.
Mike Martin: New Hampshire. All right. All right, guys.
 
 
00:08:28
 
Mike Martin: Well, I don't want to take everyone's time. This is a quick just update for everybody just to make sure we're all on the same page. We've got uh a bunch of things that are all pending each other is the way I'm going to describe it. So, we've got our HubSpot thing that we're dealing with. We have our middleware that we're dealing with. We have um the data cleanup process with the 80,000 uh entries that we've got to clean up. So, with with all of these things that we currently have in the air that are kind of all pending on this particular project, there has been a request from Kenan to to hold off for a little bit. so he can, you know, get some data cleaned up in the system. One of the things because Kenan is new, I want to make sure that everybody here understands holdups and pauses at this point in our project, I want defined and I want him to have all the resources he needs to limit that time. So when I hear two weeks of data, it scares the s*** out of me.
 
 
00:09:29
 
Mike Martin: I want to know what we're doing because you know an analogy that Matoyer gave me I think kind of rings true. We have plumbing and then we've got the water flow that goes in the plumbing and we do need to get this third party company building this out and part of that needs to I think happen at the same time that we're cleaning the data. And so because I'm hearing bits of information from Kenan, a little bit of information from Alex, little bit of information from Mike, I really want to close this gap here today and understand where we are. What are our true deadlines? Are we still on track to hit what we're we've all been talking about, which is 91, and have some true measurement here. Um, and with that, I'll open up the floor to anybody who wants to jump in and either correct me, set me straight, or or tell me everything I just said is accurate and give me some dates.
Alex Mazzei: Is is and Mike Mets with you?
Mike Martin: Mike Mets was invited to this meeting.
 
 
00:10:31
 
Mike Martin: I know he's on the meeting. He's not here, though. He was there. Uh, let me go grab him. I'll go walk over and grab him. I'll be right back. just uh kind of where I'm sitting at.
Alex Mazzei: Thank you.
Mike Martin: We have a meeting with Strawos today on how to better organize the parent child relationship in the system. Currently, we have all the data. It's in the system. However, when sales orders get created in Big Commerce with delivery addresses, those delivery addresses don't live on the customer record themselves. They just live on the sales orders. So, we need that data on um like new sales orders, new delivery addresses to be also applied to the customer record itself. So we have all the data sitting in one place. That's something Diana's and Mike are dealing with too. They're pulling we're pulling the customer data from Dynamics but all the addresses are not there. So we're to manipulate the delivery addresses to kind of uh link them to the correct parent account.
 
 
00:11:19
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah,
Mike Martin: The what's considered the parent account is the invoice account. Uh so that's the top level of it. So assuming that we think there's lower levels to that then we then we can reorganize the the delivery addresses to create chains. Um because right now the current way that we organize it through dynamics it's it's actually like a marketing module but it's it's a manual thing that we have to manually create the chain and all that. It's not efficient. The field is there but it's in the marketing section of the customer record. Got it. But I mean it's it it can live there. That's fine. And we just have to to ident correctly identify each of the company chains to make sure all the MSOs have all of their children underneath that chain. So we have the parent address which is the billing address and then we have the child addresses which are going to be delivery addresses shipping addresses.
Alex Mazzei: Was the the information from Emerald Intel able to help you at all, Kenan?
 
 
00:12:34
 
Mike Martin: We did not even cross check it with that. I mean that that data is important but it's it's all national, you know, that that's kind of encompassing everybody like people that we don't even serve. Um I mean it could be helpful for sales for sure. Um but we haven't cross- checked it. That that is something we can do whenever we we do our final audit. Um, that could be helpful in doing the USPS address format as well. Yep.
Mike Metoyer: So
Alex Mazzei: So basically what I'm hearing is you have the data that you're able to collect and you have two different One addresses. is the the shipping and one is the billing address. And you're using that information as the parent child relationship to set this up as a initial master sheet or master list.
Mike Martin: Right. In dynamics. Yep.
Alex Mazzei: And how confident are you everything that you need like and you're moving in the direction you need? Like what what support or help do you need from us?
 
 
00:13:30
 
Mike Martin: pretty confident because every pretty confident because every every address that comes from Big Commerce is a shipping address.
Alex Mazzei: Okay.
Mike Martin: They don't even denote billing address on their right. um that we did find billing addresses and the only reason I say this is because we found like a good bunch of PO addresses and we don't ship to PO so I'm assuming but those those addresses they might
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, you do have the billing
Mike Martin: but do those those billing addresses don't come over in the integration right so anything that is in Dynamics I can't understand is a shipping address in theory unless they mistakenly put their invoice address as a shipping address, which could happen, I guess. All right, guys. We're back.
Mike Metoyer: Well, and and Kenan, even with that, I would say the customers that do have a billing address, I would say less than 5% of our records, if that, actually use that billing address. Um, most people just use the shipping.
Mike Martin: We're invoicing. Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Uh yeah, for for uh like yeah, like our customers for invoicing.
 
 
00:14:36
 
Mike Martin: Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Yes. Um for sure. Uh specifically because we're not we're not in the 90s anymore where we're not hand mailing these invoices out. Um it's it's typically via email and so they want to actually see what shipping address that the invoice is tied to. Um,
Mike Martin: Gota way to the shipping address because that's what the invoice comes with. But that's what our customer prefers.
Mike Metoyer: So I guess I guess just touching on on So I I is.
Mike Martin: You can pay me and I can throw it in the trash if you want. I'm happy to do that. It'd be faster. But uh I wanted to uh point out that Mike is organizing our data that we pulled um through Big Commerce to kind of um simulate what we want to see in dynamics um pinpointing which ones would be the chains and which ones are their child accounts which are the delivery um addresses. And then the third part of that is creating like a region which as you know Mike like for example Curleaf likes their building per states um that's what we would consider a region but there's other MSOs's that handle their AP across different states but that's the the next step of that.
 
 
00:16:12
 
Mike Martin: So again, just just to recap, so I want to make sure because bringing Mike in, which I didn't have him in involved initially, but understanding he's working on parent child relationships, which kind of all ties into the HubSpot thing, which all ties into the middleware. So, I just want to get on the same page real quick with everybody and again close some dates off and make sure that we're not duplicating each other's work. And especially if he's put in enough time on this, we can run with what he has. Uh or vice versa, if someone else is already putting in time on this, we we just get together and collaborate. So, Alex, I know you had a question for Mike. That's why I went to go grab him. You want to jump back on?
Alex Mazzei: No, I just know that between what he was showing me in his office and some of the Google meets that we had of the data in his Excel spreadsheets, he had a lot of information organized. And I know Kenan and him were working together on that.
 
 
00:17:09
 
Alex Mazzei: And I just wanted him to be in this meeting because I feel like he has the ability that he's understanding what needs to happen, but he's also looking at the information. So when he's looking at it, he knows if it's right or wrong. and and I know Keenan has the back end of the ERP stuff as his skill set. So having both of those people in this meeting was paramount for me.
Mike Martin: So I mean everybody on the line here, everybody understands the parent child relationship. Everybody understands the middleware. Everybody understands what we're trying to get accomplished with dynamics, HubSpot, and Big Commerce. Is there anyone that's on the line that does not understand what we're trying to get accomplished? Then as we move forward, it's going to make sense because I need to know where we're at with timelines. When when's my next deadline? When what what's when's my next action item, deliverable? Where are we at? Meeting today with Straw Bus to review the best way to organize this data in Dynamics.
 
 
00:18:12
 
Mike Martin: Um once we have that methodology, then we can import the clean data that Mike has. Um we'll have to work on a import template for that. Um but once that's established, we should have correct hierarchy. We're also going to have to talk to strus about how we classify those uh regional operators and remove the tree. So I guess by the end of day we can probably have a good idea of how long the system will take based on what they tell us. I'd say so. Yeah. So then once they tell us that what's the next step? Organizing the data. um getting the data set up and in an import template that Kenan can use to upload to dynamics and then subsequent mail file and again I'm the idiot in the room speaking we're doing all this in sandbox. Yes. Right. Everybody understands we're doing all this in sandbox. Okay. So then when's an expectation that this will be done in sandbox, approved in sandbox that we can I can look forward to then moving forward with the other projects or can these other projects be moving simultaneously with this project?
 
 
00:19:18
 
Mike Martin: Right. Where we at with the middleware company? We I sent an email a couple days ago told and told them to hold off for at least a couple weeks. Okay. Why a couple weeks? Why not five days? Why not two days? Why not three days? Because I don't know what the timeline Strauss is going to give us. on or even if they have I don't even know if if they have the current um hierarchy relationship even in dynamics. I don't know they do. So okay. Yeah, it's there. So it could be five days. It could be two weeks. Okay. What what I'm going to say is we probably this meeting is probably premature understanding what I just found out. Probably need to have this meeting after you we have this meeting with Strao. So we're going to put this back on the calendar probably for Monday. That's okay with everybody else. Any other questions I need to understand what Mike?
 
 
00:20:06
 
Mike Martin: Go ahead.
Mike Metoyer: Yeah. So, uh I know you guys are you have a huge focus on uh Dynamics, which obviously that's going to be our source of truth. Uh when we're actually porting it over to HubSpot, um you know, originally uh they uh Instrumental Group was going to use the domain name as far as like uh connecting the accounts um and emails. Um I don't know if that's going to be the best way. So, I I was playing around in HubSpot and there is actually a field where you can input a Bitcommerce customer ID number. Um, and so with that, I don't know if we could uh create a workflow or have Make Web Better import that information from Big Commerce uh before we shut it off just so it's an easy match. Um, but yeah, I just wanted to ask you guys on that. It looks like Danny um is in charge of the workflows on that side.
Mike Martin: So once once an order is created in Big Commerce, it gets pushed to both Dynamics and HubSpot.
 
 
00:21:01
 
Mike Martin: That has to have a unique identifier that that's the same across both platforms, right? So that's the field that you're trying to put into HubSpot. Mike, that unique identifier, how's it being read right now, Mike?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, it's essentially uh Yeah.
Mike Martin: email.
Mike Metoyer: Uh I I don't know. Uh that's a question for Mike Martin. I think he has it uh based on email, the contacts.
Mike Martin: Yeah. Yeah. So uh the the flow goes uh email which goes uh which is a contact and um HubSpot automatically generates uh the primary company associated with the contact as long as it's uh a URL that's readable. So, if it's Mike M at Gmail, then it wouldn't create a uh company associated with Mike Martin because it's a Gmail account. So, there are some scenarios like that in HubSpot, but for the most part, that's how it's set up currently where it's automated by URL uh on the email. How how confident do you guys feel about the organization of the companies in in HubSpot where we can reference that as far as like okay so this company belongs to this chain HubSpot I feel we haven't done a
 
 
00:22:21
 
Mike Metoyer: I don't think we should go that route, but what do you what do you think, Martin?
Mike Martin: lot of hygiene anything that's been done has been automated that's probably going to be accurate but when it's um there are some situations where there's secondary tertiary level like Schwaz is a good example where it's not smart enough to read that and then we've been some people have been doing it by hand where they they have uh uh star buds and then they show primary is schwaz secondary is emeralds fields and they've been kind of just uh dragging and dropping that. So the question we have to ask ourselves is so everything in in Dynamics is driven by company uh billing um and everything pretty much in HubSpot's driven by contact and shipping. So that's where we're going to have to think through how do we combine how how do we merge the data? The origin is always big commerce. So we there should be a unique identifier. Yeah. It's an email right now and that's where problem lies.
 
 
00:23:40
 
Mike Martin: It should be a unique identifier that is a customer ID. It should not be an email or a contact or anything that's going to constantly evolve or change. That's a mistake. It should be ran by some form of customer number. Um and even with that there should be a hierarchy within the customer numbers. You can make your customer numbers however you want. So if I decided that one, two was curleaf, then I've got a hund, you know, 200 stores or whatever after that that I know everything one, two is curleaf, one, two, one is cure leaf one. One, two, two is cure leaf two, one, two, three is curle leaf four. Um, and you can push that all the way out through all of your MSOs through your unique identifiers. Or you can just do them chronologically. Just throw them in, you know, customer one through 10,00. But in either case, in my opinion, that's the way it should be.
Mike Metoyer: So, so how we have it right now is that unique identifier is in the uh the URL up top.
 
 
00:24:38
 
Mike Metoyer: So, for instance, I'm on Guushi's account. uh their bastard account is 13621. So ultimately before we we do this integration with uh dynamics to HubSpot there is a field in HubSpot on this bottom I just added it big commerce customer ID number. So there has to be a workflow where we can get that number and plug it into here. So when we're doing our our our lookup or whatever for Dynamics and our HubSpot customers, it's an automatic match and and we don't have to worry about it. So ideally I would Yeah.
Mike Martin: Who who has this connector right now? Who has the most information on this connector? And whoever's running this connector right now for us is the person that can I mean that's just another addition. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: So based on this make web better, it looks like Danny um was the one that was kind of touching it um last, but this was a couple years ago. This was last year in 2024. So, um I'm not 100% sure.
Mike Martin: Danny, Zach, any input is is adding That field going to be a problem.
 
 
00:25:43
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah, we just uh Go ahead, Danny. But yeah, that's that's what the connection between HubSpot and BigCom is. That's what we use it. We got we have to look into it. So today we can
Daniel Bagaporo: So the thing about that is make web better has its own specific set of parameters that it looks for. I'm looking at its configurations and it looks like that maybe I can I can look around and see what is in there but customer ID sync doesn't seem to be part of its uh automations. For example, um, uh, Matoyer, the, uh, the that Juicy customer ID, what was it again?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, it is going to be 13621.
Daniel Bagaporo: Okay, let me see. So, I'm going to share my screen in just a second here and kind of just uh show you how customer information gets ported over. And I'm going to use Juicy as an example. One second. So what you see right now is kind of like where everything that we see off of make web better.
 
 
00:27:10
 
Daniel Bagaporo: This is how customers are getting synced. It looks like that there are some missing fields here. And I went to go and look at this one in particular. Uh for whatever reason, this is pretty much what shows up in that in that contacts information, right? So, it's not sure where it's reading all of this information, but it's definitely just based off of it's it looks like it's based off of just like the email address. That's where the contact gets sync because email address is common between the customer uh information, the order information and so on, right? to sync off of the uh company ID or the customer group ID. There are two ways about that. The 13621 is the is essentially kind of like what I keep labeling as the BTOC portion of it, but there's also this company ID down here pulled through API which is the B2B uh company ID. So in terms of what to sync from where there are multiple avenues that we can kind of pull that kind of information.
 
 
00:28:19
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Oh wait I let me present sorry. Right. So this is uh so this is the the contact uh the company ID from B TOC 13621 entered up here and the return information is being pulled from the B2B record or API record. So there there are the the one thing that we need to get straight is where are we going to start pulling this information from? Because uh as I explained to Kenan, the original connector was built with B2C in mind, but then we eventually moved on to upgrading to kind of like a B2B environment in Big Commerce. And yeah.
Mike Martin: Yep. We never redesigned it when we start.
Mike Metoyer: What what's what's that line ID uh on number 23? Is that BC uh group ID 1362 something?
Daniel Bagaporo: uh at the top here.
Mike Metoyer: No, it's line 23. 1362. That's interesting.
Daniel Bagaporo: 923. Oh, yeah.
Zach Ungerman: 1362. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: It's missing the one.
Daniel Bagaporo: Looks like that, huh? Let me see. Let me try pulling it up.
 
 
00:29:49
 
Mike Metoyer: And and if we need to do this as a whole group, that's totally cool. If if not, we can do this offline up the meeting just so we don't waste everybody's time.
Daniel Bagaporo: Right.
Mike Martin: And here's the thing. I I I think we probably do need to go offline, but again, my my whole goal of this, I don't want to take everyone's time. It's Friday. Everyone's got a lot of s*** to do. I just want to get some deadlines and some true expectations because what's happening for me is there's all of these projects that are all involved in this one thing that I've just explained to everybody. because they're all bottlenecked at this point. I feel like there's a lot of people going everything's on hold because Keenan wants two weeks and I need to make sure that that isn't the case. And if it is the case that we're doing everything we can in the background in lie of what he's doing and then if we're we've done all that then we're providing all the resources that are necessary to shut this two weeks down to three or four days.
 
 
00:30:45
 
Mike Martin: Okay. Have one more question. Matoyer, do you are you organizing based on HubSpot or any of your other data besides Dynamics um the hierarchy or all the different um delivery addresses for your chains that we can also cross reference
Mike Metoyer: Uh I personally don't have a spreadsheet but uh the best uh location to do that is the B2B app uh in Big Commerce uh because that's where we set parent child accounts and the junior senior buyers.
Mike Martin: Bill can help with that. Okay. Sounds good. Export. I'm wondering if we should do a overarching document that maps how we're uh data hygiene and the cadence of what we're doing. We're going to do this first. We're going to do this second. We're going to do this. Mike is doing it as far as the hierarchy goes. Um I we just and then the order of sequence. Yes. Because Yeah. We're going to have to review that. Yes. Right now I have I'm doing it by uh shipping address from Big Commerce, tying it to the account number and dynamics.
 
 
00:32:01
 
Mike Martin: Yeah. Then tying it back to the customer name and then region and kind of doing a reverse engineer to see if our information is right. What I think would help is that because there's a lot of information that's just in people's heads about customer hierarchies that we don't know that isn't mapped out in dynamics. If Mike, you or the sales team wanted to find out a way to create your own mockup of parent child relationships as far as we have that emerald intel. Perfect. That's 100% correct. Perfect. Then we use that to compare against mine and then we iterate those two and create a decision matrix on what is really the deciding factor. Is it the email shipping address or is it a mixture of both? Which one takes precedence over the other? Right. So what do we need to do to get that done? Uh well the Emerald Intel um did the parent child mapping so that's that's accurate. So and that's a that's a a pivot table spreadsheet.
 
 
00:33:01
 
Mike Martin: Have you seen that? Alex, is that what you shared with me uh last year? Something that Alex worked on.
Alex Mazzei: That that was the CSV. It's a CSV file, but it also has all the customers in the industry, not only their their uh and the the customers. So, it's like a master masterly of all of the parent child relationships based on their um mechanism that they use to identify which ones are parent and child.
Mike Martin: See, that's something we could use on the customer intake side where it's predictive in a sense where if we have a location that we didn't previously have, it would recommend the customer uh setup in dynamics.
Alex Mazzei: And the way I was looking at it was this is the closest
Mike Martin: So I'll take a look at that um distill it down to what our customers are and then do a onetoone match. All right.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, quick question for Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: So we work on that.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, do we have a HubSpot developer environment?
Mike Martin: Yes. I do not believe we do.
 
 
00:34:09
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Because from there, I can probably dig into HubSpot's API capabilities and kind of see what can be pulled from HubSpot and maybe we can find some connections that way.
Mike Martin: Um,
Alex Mazzei: I believe you have a sandbox with the account that you have that you're paying for with HubSpot.
Daniel Bagaporo: Well, maybe because I'm looking to get into its actual developer environment uh where it can like expose web hooks and API calls.
Alex Mazzei: Is that what you're asking?
Mike Martin: We don't have our phone.
Alex Mazzei: Stop. Look at the documentation.
Mike Martin: Yeah, but we don't have the credentials. There is docu There is API documentation for sure and Danny's probably looking at it, but we don't have a a dedicated environment for ourselves. I'm not aware of it anyways.
Daniel Bagaporo: Gotcha.
Mike Martin: All right. Um, so you're going to work on that. You got that Excel sheet. Yeah. Okay. So, you're going to work on that. You're going to meet with Stravo and you're going to get back.
 
 
00:35:08
 
Mike Martin: I need you to put something on the calendar for Monday or Tuesday. Right. So, we have action items there. Alex, can can you update me on this $80,000 or $80,000 this $80,000 part cleanup data cleanup that we were doing in in in HubSpot? I know we we had talked about it and and I don't know if we put any tools in place to kind of scrub it and consolidate. Um, but after talking to Mike here, it sounds like he's as good or if not better than I am in Excel, which means maybe we can have him work on some of that scrub if we haven't done it already. Um, can anyone, whether it's Alex or Matoyer, update me on where we're at with the HubSpot cleanup?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, I I haven't really seen seen too much.
Mike Martin: We haven't done anything.
Alex Mazzei: The only thing that I did was I took the Emerald Intel information and pinned it with the information that I got from the customer table from the dynamics and then once I was getting a confirmation from that I was going to move into if it made sense with the HubSpot and do the same approach but I have to break it down by state because the the information is too much to run with one one sweep.
 
 
00:36:26
 
Mike Martin: So these are the tentacles I'm talking about why it's why I wanted to have this.
Zach Ungerman: Oh, okay.
Mike Martin: So you're working on a project that he he can't move forward until you're done.
Zach Ungerman: So on on Phil by
Mike Martin: Okay. Right. So understanding that puts us in a place where I need you to help me prioritize his time where I get Alex what he needs so I can move this project forward. Okay. So he's going to work on that for you, Alex. He'll get that back to you. He'll put a timet on it after he looks at it. I'll have him send you an email on where we're at with that. Um you're going to set a meeting up. We'll meet again next week. I'm sorry I can't hear you.
Zach Ungerman: by scrub. Uh, do we are we talking about what Martin and the three of us have been talking about for a while? Data hygiene. Is that what we're talking about?
 
 
00:37:14
 
Zach Ungerman: Because we we kind of kind of we've been sitting here talking about data hygiene, but who's doing the data hygiene?
Mike Martin: Yes.
Zach Ungerman: Like, is that Mike?
Alex Mazzei: Hey,
Mike Martin: Literally what we just talked about.
Zach Ungerman: Okay.
Mike Martin: So Mike Mets has a template from Intel uh intelligence, whatever the hell that the third word party.
Zach Ungerman: Mike Mets. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Mike Martin: He's going to match that to his own records for the parent child. We're going to come up with the parent child relationships and through the parent child relationships, he's going to give that back to Alex. Alex is then going to use that as confirmed data and then scrub the rest of it and get rid of all the ones that shouldn't be there and give that back to us. At that point, someone has to then be in charge of uploading it back into HubSpot and getting the act the data loaded. So, who's going to do that? Jim. Sure. Okay. So, I'm on the same page and everyone else here understands. It's in Mike Mets's court right now. It's going to be passed to Alex. Alex then's going to get it to Kenan. Kenan's going to set a meeting on Monday to tell us what Strao said so we can shorten down our timeline and get back to our intel intelligence conversation and build that in. By next Wednesday, everybody should have a lot more clarity. Do I understand this right? Everybody out there, is that your understanding? Danny, Zack, Mike.
Zach Ungerman: Y yeah.
Mike Metoyer: Yep.
Mike Martin: All right, let's go after it, guys.
Mike Metoyer: The only thing I ask is The only thing I ask is before we do any imports uh to HubSpot uh just to verify with me or Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: Let's do it.
Mike Metoyer: But that's it.
Mike Martin: It's got to be done in sandbox and and we got to have a HubSpot sandbox. I don't want to f*** everything up worse than we already have.
Mike Metoyer: Go.
Mike Martin: All right. Anything else?
Daniel Bagaporo: No.

Hubspot and parent child clean up update  - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Mike Metoyer: What up, Alex? I'm good, brother. How you doing?
Alex Mazzei: What's going on?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, as far as uh far as what?
Alex Mazzei: I'm all right. You guys get anywhere like any updates on like things that are moving forward.
Mike Metoyer: Um, so I kind of I haven't really been touching too many IT projects to be honest with you, so I I can't necessarily answer that. I know um HubSpot, I don't know if Zach was involved, but uh Kenan um and IT team I'm assuming um decided to put a little pause on the uh HubSpot project just due to uh cleaning up some uh company records and contacts because he was telling me in Dynamics he might have to create new or different forms to actually plug into Sky Villa um if we even go that route. He was like I was looking at a couple other options too. So, I'm not sure on uh on that piece, but yeah, we can hear a little more from him, but uh I did have something that I I did want to show you and and I could wait uh just to show you before we Yeah.
 
 
00:04:33
 
Mike Metoyer: So, everybody's in the call and they can see what I'm talking about. But, uh as we're cleaning up uh HubSpot just to match dynamics, just some of that data. Uh I actually looked into some of the fields. Um and there's actually a field called Big Commerce customer ID. Um, and so I guess before we we do make this transition to make web better, I was going to see if we could use that uh that middleware software or whatever to actually plug in the Big Commerce ID
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Mike Metoyer: number from the customer um into into HubSpot. I I don't know um if it's an option. Uh I just yeah was playing around with it and wanted to see.
Alex Mazzei: How you doing, Z?
Zach Ungerman: I'm doing well.
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Zach Ungerman: So, just Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, there's a few more people on the meeting, right?
Mike Metoyer: You uh you
Alex Mazzei: So, I I didn't want to go into too much details until we had everybody that were supposed to be on this main.
 
 
00:05:32
 
Alex Mazzei: It was like seven or eight people.
Mike Metoyer: There's a lot of people for sure.
Zach Ungerman: So, most of them are in the office. So, just wait for them to log on before we continue.
Mike Metoyer: Alex, you back home. Where you at? Damn. Okay. Jeez. Hopefully you're getting some good food out there, too.
Mike Martin: It's just Alex is join us. Looks like everybody. How are we doing?
Mike Metoyer: What's up? Good. How you guys doing?
Mike Martin: Good, good, good. How are you?
Zach Ungerman: Good.
Mike Metoyer: Good.
Mike Martin: Look at all those handsome faces, man. Good looking group.
Alex Mazzei: What's up, guys? I'm I'm in transition and there's like spotty uh cellular some.
Mike Martin: All right. Where what city are you in now, Alex?
Alex Mazzei: I don't know. It's Claremont for Mont. I don't know where the hell I am. New Hampshire.
Mike Martin: New Hampshire. All right. All right, guys.
 
 
00:08:28
 
Mike Martin: Well, I don't want to take everyone's time. This is a quick just update for everybody just to make sure we're all on the same page. We've got uh a bunch of things that are all pending each other is the way I'm going to describe it. So, we've got our HubSpot thing that we're dealing with. We have our middleware that we're dealing with. We have um the data cleanup process with the 80,000 uh entries that we've got to clean up. So, with with all of these things that we currently have in the air that are kind of all pending on this particular project, there has been a request from Kenan to to hold off for a little bit. so he can, you know, get some data cleaned up in the system. One of the things because Kenan is new, I want to make sure that everybody here understands holdups and pauses at this point in our project, I want defined and I want him to have all the resources he needs to limit that time. So when I hear two weeks of data, it scares the s*** out of me.
 
 
00:09:29
 
Mike Martin: I want to know what we're doing because you know an analogy that Matoyer gave me I think kind of rings true. We have plumbing and then we've got the water flow that goes in the plumbing and we do need to get this third party company building this out and part of that needs to I think happen at the same time that we're cleaning the data. And so because I'm hearing bits of information from Kenan, a little bit of information from Alex, little bit of information from Mike, I really want to close this gap here today and understand where we are. What are our true deadlines? Are we still on track to hit what we're we've all been talking about, which is 91, and have some true measurement here. Um, and with that, I'll open up the floor to anybody who wants to jump in and either correct me, set me straight, or or tell me everything I just said is accurate and give me some dates.
Alex Mazzei: Is is and Mike Mets with you?
Mike Martin: Mike Mets was invited to this meeting.
 
 
00:10:31
 
Mike Martin: I know he's on the meeting. He's not here, though. He was there. Uh, let me go grab him. I'll go walk over and grab him. I'll be right back. just uh kind of where I'm sitting at.
Alex Mazzei: Thank you.
Mike Martin: We have a meeting with Strawos today on how to better organize the parent child relationship in the system. Currently, we have all the data. It's in the system. However, when sales orders get created in Big Commerce with delivery addresses, those delivery addresses don't live on the customer record themselves. They just live on the sales orders. So, we need that data on um like new sales orders, new delivery addresses to be also applied to the customer record itself. So we have all the data sitting in one place. That's something Diana's and Mike are dealing with too. They're pulling we're pulling the customer data from Dynamics but all the addresses are not there. So we're to manipulate the delivery addresses to kind of uh link them to the correct parent account.
 
 
00:11:19
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah,
Mike Martin: The what's considered the parent account is the invoice account. Uh so that's the top level of it. So assuming that we think there's lower levels to that then we then we can reorganize the the delivery addresses to create chains. Um because right now the current way that we organize it through dynamics it's it's actually like a marketing module but it's it's a manual thing that we have to manually create the chain and all that. It's not efficient. The field is there but it's in the marketing section of the customer record. Got it. But I mean it's it it can live there. That's fine. And we just have to to ident correctly identify each of the company chains to make sure all the MSOs have all of their children underneath that chain. So we have the parent address which is the billing address and then we have the child addresses which are going to be delivery addresses shipping addresses.
Alex Mazzei: Was the the information from Emerald Intel able to help you at all, Kenan?
 
 
00:12:34
 
Mike Martin: We did not even cross check it with that. I mean that that data is important but it's it's all national, you know, that that's kind of encompassing everybody like people that we don't even serve. Um I mean it could be helpful for sales for sure. Um but we haven't cross- checked it. That that is something we can do whenever we we do our final audit. Um, that could be helpful in doing the USPS address format as well. Yep.
Mike Metoyer: So
Alex Mazzei: So basically what I'm hearing is you have the data that you're able to collect and you have two different One addresses. is the the shipping and one is the billing address. And you're using that information as the parent child relationship to set this up as a initial master sheet or master list.
Mike Martin: Right. In dynamics. Yep.
Alex Mazzei: And how confident are you everything that you need like and you're moving in the direction you need? Like what what support or help do you need from us?
 
 
00:13:30
 
Mike Martin: pretty confident because every pretty confident because every every address that comes from Big Commerce is a shipping address.
Alex Mazzei: Okay.
Mike Martin: They don't even denote billing address on their right. um that we did find billing addresses and the only reason I say this is because we found like a good bunch of PO addresses and we don't ship to PO so I'm assuming but those those addresses they might
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, you do have the billing
Mike Martin: but do those those billing addresses don't come over in the integration right so anything that is in Dynamics I can't understand is a shipping address in theory unless they mistakenly put their invoice address as a shipping address, which could happen, I guess. All right, guys. We're back.
Mike Metoyer: Well, and and Kenan, even with that, I would say the customers that do have a billing address, I would say less than 5% of our records, if that, actually use that billing address. Um, most people just use the shipping.
Mike Martin: We're invoicing. Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Uh yeah, for for uh like yeah, like our customers for invoicing.
 
 
00:14:36
 
Mike Martin: Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Yes. Um for sure. Uh specifically because we're not we're not in the 90s anymore where we're not hand mailing these invoices out. Um it's it's typically via email and so they want to actually see what shipping address that the invoice is tied to. Um,
Mike Martin: Gota way to the shipping address because that's what the invoice comes with. But that's what our customer prefers.
Mike Metoyer: So I guess I guess just touching on on So I I is.
Mike Martin: You can pay me and I can throw it in the trash if you want. I'm happy to do that. It'd be faster. But uh I wanted to uh point out that Mike is organizing our data that we pulled um through Big Commerce to kind of um simulate what we want to see in dynamics um pinpointing which ones would be the chains and which ones are their child accounts which are the delivery um addresses. And then the third part of that is creating like a region which as you know Mike like for example Curleaf likes their building per states um that's what we would consider a region but there's other MSOs's that handle their AP across different states but that's the the next step of that.
 
 
00:16:12
 
Mike Martin: So again, just just to recap, so I want to make sure because bringing Mike in, which I didn't have him in involved initially, but understanding he's working on parent child relationships, which kind of all ties into the HubSpot thing, which all ties into the middleware. So, I just want to get on the same page real quick with everybody and again close some dates off and make sure that we're not duplicating each other's work. And especially if he's put in enough time on this, we can run with what he has. Uh or vice versa, if someone else is already putting in time on this, we we just get together and collaborate. So, Alex, I know you had a question for Mike. That's why I went to go grab him. You want to jump back on?
Alex Mazzei: No, I just know that between what he was showing me in his office and some of the Google meets that we had of the data in his Excel spreadsheets, he had a lot of information organized. And I know Kenan and him were working together on that.
 
 
00:17:09
 
Alex Mazzei: And I just wanted him to be in this meeting because I feel like he has the ability that he's understanding what needs to happen, but he's also looking at the information. So when he's looking at it, he knows if it's right or wrong. and and I know Keenan has the back end of the ERP stuff as his skill set. So having both of those people in this meeting was paramount for me.
Mike Martin: So I mean everybody on the line here, everybody understands the parent child relationship. Everybody understands the middleware. Everybody understands what we're trying to get accomplished with dynamics, HubSpot, and Big Commerce. Is there anyone that's on the line that does not understand what we're trying to get accomplished? Then as we move forward, it's going to make sense because I need to know where we're at with timelines. When when's my next deadline? When what what's when's my next action item, deliverable? Where are we at? Meeting today with Straw Bus to review the best way to organize this data in Dynamics.
 
 
00:18:12
 
Mike Martin: Um once we have that methodology, then we can import the clean data that Mike has. Um we'll have to work on a import template for that. Um but once that's established, we should have correct hierarchy. We're also going to have to talk to strus about how we classify those uh regional operators and remove the tree. So I guess by the end of day we can probably have a good idea of how long the system will take based on what they tell us. I'd say so. Yeah. So then once they tell us that what's the next step? Organizing the data. um getting the data set up and in an import template that Kenan can use to upload to dynamics and then subsequent mail file and again I'm the idiot in the room speaking we're doing all this in sandbox. Yes. Right. Everybody understands we're doing all this in sandbox. Okay. So then when's an expectation that this will be done in sandbox, approved in sandbox that we can I can look forward to then moving forward with the other projects or can these other projects be moving simultaneously with this project?
 
 
00:19:18
 
Mike Martin: Right. Where we at with the middleware company? We I sent an email a couple days ago told and told them to hold off for at least a couple weeks. Okay. Why a couple weeks? Why not five days? Why not two days? Why not three days? Because I don't know what the timeline Strauss is going to give us. on or even if they have I don't even know if if they have the current um hierarchy relationship even in dynamics. I don't know they do. So okay. Yeah, it's there. So it could be five days. It could be two weeks. Okay. What what I'm going to say is we probably this meeting is probably premature understanding what I just found out. Probably need to have this meeting after you we have this meeting with Strao. So we're going to put this back on the calendar probably for Monday. That's okay with everybody else. Any other questions I need to understand what Mike?
 
 
00:20:06
 
Mike Martin: Go ahead.
Mike Metoyer: Yeah. So, uh I know you guys are you have a huge focus on uh Dynamics, which obviously that's going to be our source of truth. Uh when we're actually porting it over to HubSpot, um you know, originally uh they uh Instrumental Group was going to use the domain name as far as like uh connecting the accounts um and emails. Um I don't know if that's going to be the best way. So, I I was playing around in HubSpot and there is actually a field where you can input a Bitcommerce customer ID number. Um, and so with that, I don't know if we could uh create a workflow or have Make Web Better import that information from Big Commerce uh before we shut it off just so it's an easy match. Um, but yeah, I just wanted to ask you guys on that. It looks like Danny um is in charge of the workflows on that side.
Mike Martin: So once once an order is created in Big Commerce, it gets pushed to both Dynamics and HubSpot.
 
 
00:21:01
 
Mike Martin: That has to have a unique identifier that that's the same across both platforms, right? So that's the field that you're trying to put into HubSpot. Mike, that unique identifier, how's it being read right now, Mike?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, it's essentially uh Yeah.
Mike Martin: email.
Mike Metoyer: Uh I I don't know. Uh that's a question for Mike Martin. I think he has it uh based on email, the contacts.
Mike Martin: Yeah. Yeah. So uh the the flow goes uh email which goes uh which is a contact and um HubSpot automatically generates uh the primary company associated with the contact as long as it's uh a URL that's readable. So, if it's Mike M at Gmail, then it wouldn't create a uh company associated with Mike Martin because it's a Gmail account. So, there are some scenarios like that in HubSpot, but for the most part, that's how it's set up currently where it's automated by URL uh on the email. How how confident do you guys feel about the organization of the companies in in HubSpot where we can reference that as far as like okay so this company belongs to this chain HubSpot I feel we haven't done a
 
 
00:22:21
 
Mike Metoyer: I don't think we should go that route, but what do you what do you think, Martin?
Mike Martin: lot of hygiene anything that's been done has been automated that's probably going to be accurate but when it's um there are some situations where there's secondary tertiary level like Schwaz is a good example where it's not smart enough to read that and then we've been some people have been doing it by hand where they they have uh uh star buds and then they show primary is schwaz secondary is emeralds fields and they've been kind of just uh dragging and dropping that. So the question we have to ask ourselves is so everything in in Dynamics is driven by company uh billing um and everything pretty much in HubSpot's driven by contact and shipping. So that's where we're going to have to think through how do we combine how how do we merge the data? The origin is always big commerce. So we there should be a unique identifier. Yeah. It's an email right now and that's where problem lies.
 
 
00:23:40
 
Mike Martin: It should be a unique identifier that is a customer ID. It should not be an email or a contact or anything that's going to constantly evolve or change. That's a mistake. It should be ran by some form of customer number. Um and even with that there should be a hierarchy within the customer numbers. You can make your customer numbers however you want. So if I decided that one, two was curleaf, then I've got a hund, you know, 200 stores or whatever after that that I know everything one, two is curleaf, one, two, one is cure leaf one. One, two, two is cure leaf two, one, two, three is curle leaf four. Um, and you can push that all the way out through all of your MSOs through your unique identifiers. Or you can just do them chronologically. Just throw them in, you know, customer one through 10,00. But in either case, in my opinion, that's the way it should be.
Mike Metoyer: So, so how we have it right now is that unique identifier is in the uh the URL up top.
 
 
00:24:38
 
Mike Metoyer: So, for instance, I'm on Guushi's account. uh their bastard account is 13621. So ultimately before we we do this integration with uh dynamics to HubSpot there is a field in HubSpot on this bottom I just added it big commerce customer ID number. So there has to be a workflow where we can get that number and plug it into here. So when we're doing our our our lookup or whatever for Dynamics and our HubSpot customers, it's an automatic match and and we don't have to worry about it. So ideally I would Yeah.
Mike Martin: Who who has this connector right now? Who has the most information on this connector? And whoever's running this connector right now for us is the person that can I mean that's just another addition. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: So based on this make web better, it looks like Danny um was the one that was kind of touching it um last, but this was a couple years ago. This was last year in 2024. So, um I'm not 100% sure.
Mike Martin: Danny, Zach, any input is is adding That field going to be a problem.
 
 
00:25:43
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah, we just uh Go ahead, Danny. But yeah, that's that's what the connection between HubSpot and BigCom is. That's what we use it. We got we have to look into it. So today we can
Daniel Bagaporo: So the thing about that is make web better has its own specific set of parameters that it looks for. I'm looking at its configurations and it looks like that maybe I can I can look around and see what is in there but customer ID sync doesn't seem to be part of its uh automations. For example, um, uh, Matoyer, the, uh, the that Juicy customer ID, what was it again?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, it is going to be 13621.
Daniel Bagaporo: Okay, let me see. So, I'm going to share my screen in just a second here and kind of just uh show you how customer information gets ported over. And I'm going to use Juicy as an example. One second. So what you see right now is kind of like where everything that we see off of make web better.
 
 
00:27:10
 
Daniel Bagaporo: This is how customers are getting synced. It looks like that there are some missing fields here. And I went to go and look at this one in particular. Uh for whatever reason, this is pretty much what shows up in that in that contacts information, right? So, it's not sure where it's reading all of this information, but it's definitely just based off of it's it looks like it's based off of just like the email address. That's where the contact gets sync because email address is common between the customer uh information, the order information and so on, right? to sync off of the uh company ID or the customer group ID. There are two ways about that. The 13621 is the is essentially kind of like what I keep labeling as the BTOC portion of it, but there's also this company ID down here pulled through API which is the B2B uh company ID. So in terms of what to sync from where there are multiple avenues that we can kind of pull that kind of information.
 
 
00:28:19
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Oh wait I let me present sorry. Right. So this is uh so this is the the contact uh the company ID from B TOC 13621 entered up here and the return information is being pulled from the B2B record or API record. So there there are the the one thing that we need to get straight is where are we going to start pulling this information from? Because uh as I explained to Kenan, the original connector was built with B2C in mind, but then we eventually moved on to upgrading to kind of like a B2B environment in Big Commerce. And yeah.
Mike Martin: Yep. We never redesigned it when we start.
Mike Metoyer: What what's what's that line ID uh on number 23? Is that BC uh group ID 1362 something?
Daniel Bagaporo: uh at the top here.
Mike Metoyer: No, it's line 23. 1362. That's interesting.
Daniel Bagaporo: 923. Oh, yeah.
Zach Ungerman: 1362. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: It's missing the one.
Daniel Bagaporo: Looks like that, huh? Let me see. Let me try pulling it up.
 
 
00:29:49
 
Mike Metoyer: And and if we need to do this as a whole group, that's totally cool. If if not, we can do this offline up the meeting just so we don't waste everybody's time.
Daniel Bagaporo: Right.
Mike Martin: And here's the thing. I I I think we probably do need to go offline, but again, my my whole goal of this, I don't want to take everyone's time. It's Friday. Everyone's got a lot of s*** to do. I just want to get some deadlines and some true expectations because what's happening for me is there's all of these projects that are all involved in this one thing that I've just explained to everybody. because they're all bottlenecked at this point. I feel like there's a lot of people going everything's on hold because Keenan wants two weeks and I need to make sure that that isn't the case. And if it is the case that we're doing everything we can in the background in lie of what he's doing and then if we're we've done all that then we're providing all the resources that are necessary to shut this two weeks down to three or four days.
 
 
00:30:45
 
Mike Martin: Okay. Have one more question. Matoyer, do you are you organizing based on HubSpot or any of your other data besides Dynamics um the hierarchy or all the different um delivery addresses for your chains that we can also cross reference
Mike Metoyer: Uh I personally don't have a spreadsheet but uh the best uh location to do that is the B2B app uh in Big Commerce uh because that's where we set parent child accounts and the junior senior buyers.
Mike Martin: Bill can help with that. Okay. Sounds good. Export. I'm wondering if we should do a overarching document that maps how we're uh data hygiene and the cadence of what we're doing. We're going to do this first. We're going to do this second. We're going to do this. Mike is doing it as far as the hierarchy goes. Um I we just and then the order of sequence. Yes. Because Yeah. We're going to have to review that. Yes. Right now I have I'm doing it by uh shipping address from Big Commerce, tying it to the account number and dynamics.
 
 
00:32:01
 
Mike Martin: Yeah. Then tying it back to the customer name and then region and kind of doing a reverse engineer to see if our information is right. What I think would help is that because there's a lot of information that's just in people's heads about customer hierarchies that we don't know that isn't mapped out in dynamics. If Mike, you or the sales team wanted to find out a way to create your own mockup of parent child relationships as far as we have that emerald intel. Perfect. That's 100% correct. Perfect. Then we use that to compare against mine and then we iterate those two and create a decision matrix on what is really the deciding factor. Is it the email shipping address or is it a mixture of both? Which one takes precedence over the other? Right. So what do we need to do to get that done? Uh well the Emerald Intel um did the parent child mapping so that's that's accurate. So and that's a that's a a pivot table spreadsheet.
 
 
00:33:01
 
Mike Martin: Have you seen that? Alex, is that what you shared with me uh last year? Something that Alex worked on.
Alex Mazzei: That that was the CSV. It's a CSV file, but it also has all the customers in the industry, not only their their uh and the the customers. So, it's like a master masterly of all of the parent child relationships based on their um mechanism that they use to identify which ones are parent and child.
Mike Martin: See, that's something we could use on the customer intake side where it's predictive in a sense where if we have a location that we didn't previously have, it would recommend the customer uh setup in dynamics.
Alex Mazzei: And the way I was looking at it was this is the closest
Mike Martin: So I'll take a look at that um distill it down to what our customers are and then do a onetoone match. All right.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, quick question for Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: So we work on that.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, do we have a HubSpot developer environment?
Mike Martin: Yes. I do not believe we do.
 
 
00:34:09
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Because from there, I can probably dig into HubSpot's API capabilities and kind of see what can be pulled from HubSpot and maybe we can find some connections that way.
Mike Martin: Um,
Alex Mazzei: I believe you have a sandbox with the account that you have that you're paying for with HubSpot.
Daniel Bagaporo: Well, maybe because I'm looking to get into its actual developer environment uh where it can like expose web hooks and API calls.
Alex Mazzei: Is that what you're asking?
Mike Martin: We don't have our phone.
Alex Mazzei: Stop. Look at the documentation.
Mike Martin: Yeah, but we don't have the credentials. There is docu There is API documentation for sure and Danny's probably looking at it, but we don't have a a dedicated environment for ourselves. I'm not aware of it anyways.
Daniel Bagaporo: Gotcha.
Mike Martin: All right. Um, so you're going to work on that. You got that Excel sheet. Yeah. Okay. So, you're going to work on that. You're going to meet with Stravo and you're going to get back.
 
 
00:35:08
 
Mike Martin: I need you to put something on the calendar for Monday or Tuesday. Right. So, we have action items there. Alex, can can you update me on this $80,000 or $80,000 this $80,000 part cleanup data cleanup that we were doing in in in HubSpot? I know we we had talked about it and and I don't know if we put any tools in place to kind of scrub it and consolidate. Um, but after talking to Mike here, it sounds like he's as good or if not better than I am in Excel, which means maybe we can have him work on some of that scrub if we haven't done it already. Um, can anyone, whether it's Alex or Matoyer, update me on where we're at with the HubSpot cleanup?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, I I haven't really seen seen too much.
Mike Martin: We haven't done anything.
Alex Mazzei: The only thing that I did was I took the Emerald Intel information and pinned it with the information that I got from the customer table from the dynamics and then once I was getting a confirmation from that I was going to move into if it made sense with the HubSpot and do the same approach but I have to break it down by state because the the information is too much to run with one one sweep.
 
 
00:36:26
 
Mike Martin: So these are the tentacles I'm talking about why it's why I wanted to have this.
Zach Ungerman: Oh, okay.
Mike Martin: So you're working on a project that he he can't move forward until you're done.
Zach Ungerman: So on on Phil by
Mike Martin: Okay. Right. So understanding that puts us in a place where I need you to help me prioritize his time where I get Alex what he needs so I can move this project forward. Okay. So he's going to work on that for you, Alex. He'll get that back to you. He'll put a timet on it after he looks at it. I'll have him send you an email on where we're at with that. Um you're going to set a meeting up. We'll meet again next week. I'm sorry I can't hear you.
Zach Ungerman: by scrub. Uh, do we are we talking about what Martin and the three of us have been talking about for a while? Data hygiene. Is that what we're talking about?
 
 
00:37:14
 
Zach Ungerman: Because we we kind of kind of we've been sitting here talking about data hygiene, but who's doing the data hygiene?
Mike Martin: Yes.
Zach Ungerman: Like, is that Mike?
Alex Mazzei: Hey,
Mike Martin: Literally what we just talked about.
Zach Ungerman: Okay.
Mike Martin: So Mike Mets has a template from Intel uh intelligence, whatever the hell that the third word party.
Zach Ungerman: Mike Mets. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Mike Martin: He's going to match that to his own records for the parent child. We're going to come up with the parent child relationships and through the parent child relationships, he's going to give that back to Alex. Alex is then going to use that as confirmed data and then scrub the rest of it and get rid of all the ones that shouldn't be there and give that back to us. At that point, someone has to then be in charge of uploading it back into HubSpot and getting the act the data loaded. So, who's going to do that? Jim. Sure. Okay. So, I'm on the same page and everyone else here understands. It's in Mike Mets's court right now. It's going to be passed to Alex. Alex then's going to get it to Kenan. Kenan's going to set a meeting on Monday to tell us what Strao said so we can shorten down our timeline and get back to our intel intelligence conversation and build that in. By next Wednesday, everybody should have a lot more clarity. Do I understand this right? Everybody out there, is that your understanding? Danny, Zack, Mike.
Zach Ungerman: Y yeah.
Mike Metoyer: Yep.
Mike Martin: All right, let's go after it, guys.
Mike Metoyer: The only thing I ask is The only thing I ask is before we do any imports uh to HubSpot uh just to verify with me or Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: Let's do it.
Mike Metoyer: But that's it.
Mike Martin: It's got to be done in sandbox and and we got to have a HubSpot sandbox. I don't want to f*** everything up worse than we already have.
Mike Metoyer: Go.
Mike Martin: All right. Anything else?
Daniel Bagaporo: No.

Hubspot and parent child clean up update  - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Mike Metoyer: What up, Alex? I'm good, brother. How you doing?
Alex Mazzei: What's going on?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, as far as uh far as what?
Alex Mazzei: I'm all right. You guys get anywhere like any updates on like things that are moving forward.
Mike Metoyer: Um, so I kind of I haven't really been touching too many IT projects to be honest with you, so I I can't necessarily answer that. I know um HubSpot, I don't know if Zach was involved, but uh Kenan um and IT team I'm assuming um decided to put a little pause on the uh HubSpot project just due to uh cleaning up some uh company records and contacts because he was telling me in Dynamics he might have to create new or different forms to actually plug into Sky Villa um if we even go that route. He was like I was looking at a couple other options too. So, I'm not sure on uh on that piece, but yeah, we can hear a little more from him, but uh I did have something that I I did want to show you and and I could wait uh just to show you before we Yeah.
 
 
00:04:33
 
Mike Metoyer: So, everybody's in the call and they can see what I'm talking about. But, uh as we're cleaning up uh HubSpot just to match dynamics, just some of that data. Uh I actually looked into some of the fields. Um and there's actually a field called Big Commerce customer ID. Um, and so I guess before we we do make this transition to make web better, I was going to see if we could use that uh that middleware software or whatever to actually plug in the Big Commerce ID
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Mike Metoyer: number from the customer um into into HubSpot. I I don't know um if it's an option. Uh I just yeah was playing around with it and wanted to see.
Alex Mazzei: How you doing, Z?
Zach Ungerman: I'm doing well.
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Zach Ungerman: So, just Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, there's a few more people on the meeting, right?
Mike Metoyer: You uh you
Alex Mazzei: So, I I didn't want to go into too much details until we had everybody that were supposed to be on this main.
 
 
00:05:32
 
Alex Mazzei: It was like seven or eight people.
Mike Metoyer: There's a lot of people for sure.
Zach Ungerman: So, most of them are in the office. So, just wait for them to log on before we continue.
Mike Metoyer: Alex, you back home. Where you at? Damn. Okay. Jeez. Hopefully you're getting some good food out there, too.
Mike Martin: It's just Alex is join us. Looks like everybody. How are we doing?
Mike Metoyer: What's up? Good. How you guys doing?
Mike Martin: Good, good, good. How are you?
Zach Ungerman: Good.
Mike Metoyer: Good.
Mike Martin: Look at all those handsome faces, man. Good looking group.
Alex Mazzei: What's up, guys? I'm I'm in transition and there's like spotty uh cellular some.
Mike Martin: All right. Where what city are you in now, Alex?
Alex Mazzei: I don't know. It's Claremont for Mont. I don't know where the hell I am. New Hampshire.
Mike Martin: New Hampshire. All right. All right, guys.
 
 
00:08:28
 
Mike Martin: Well, I don't want to take everyone's time. This is a quick just update for everybody just to make sure we're all on the same page. We've got uh a bunch of things that are all pending each other is the way I'm going to describe it. So, we've got our HubSpot thing that we're dealing with. We have our middleware that we're dealing with. We have um the data cleanup process with the 80,000 uh entries that we've got to clean up. So, with with all of these things that we currently have in the air that are kind of all pending on this particular project, there has been a request from Kenan to to hold off for a little bit. so he can, you know, get some data cleaned up in the system. One of the things because Kenan is new, I want to make sure that everybody here understands holdups and pauses at this point in our project, I want defined and I want him to have all the resources he needs to limit that time. So when I hear two weeks of data, it scares the s*** out of me.
 
 
00:09:29
 
Mike Martin: I want to know what we're doing because you know an analogy that Matoyer gave me I think kind of rings true. We have plumbing and then we've got the water flow that goes in the plumbing and we do need to get this third party company building this out and part of that needs to I think happen at the same time that we're cleaning the data. And so because I'm hearing bits of information from Kenan, a little bit of information from Alex, little bit of information from Mike, I really want to close this gap here today and understand where we are. What are our true deadlines? Are we still on track to hit what we're we've all been talking about, which is 91, and have some true measurement here. Um, and with that, I'll open up the floor to anybody who wants to jump in and either correct me, set me straight, or or tell me everything I just said is accurate and give me some dates.
Alex Mazzei: Is is and Mike Mets with you?
Mike Martin: Mike Mets was invited to this meeting.
 
 
00:10:31
 
Mike Martin: I know he's on the meeting. He's not here, though. He was there. Uh, let me go grab him. I'll go walk over and grab him. I'll be right back. just uh kind of where I'm sitting at.
Alex Mazzei: Thank you.
Mike Martin: We have a meeting with Strawos today on how to better organize the parent child relationship in the system. Currently, we have all the data. It's in the system. However, when sales orders get created in Big Commerce with delivery addresses, those delivery addresses don't live on the customer record themselves. They just live on the sales orders. So, we need that data on um like new sales orders, new delivery addresses to be also applied to the customer record itself. So we have all the data sitting in one place. That's something Diana's and Mike are dealing with too. They're pulling we're pulling the customer data from Dynamics but all the addresses are not there. So we're to manipulate the delivery addresses to kind of uh link them to the correct parent account.
 
 
00:11:19
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah,
Mike Martin: The what's considered the parent account is the invoice account. Uh so that's the top level of it. So assuming that we think there's lower levels to that then we then we can reorganize the the delivery addresses to create chains. Um because right now the current way that we organize it through dynamics it's it's actually like a marketing module but it's it's a manual thing that we have to manually create the chain and all that. It's not efficient. The field is there but it's in the marketing section of the customer record. Got it. But I mean it's it it can live there. That's fine. And we just have to to ident correctly identify each of the company chains to make sure all the MSOs have all of their children underneath that chain. So we have the parent address which is the billing address and then we have the child addresses which are going to be delivery addresses shipping addresses.
Alex Mazzei: Was the the information from Emerald Intel able to help you at all, Kenan?
 
 
00:12:34
 
Mike Martin: We did not even cross check it with that. I mean that that data is important but it's it's all national, you know, that that's kind of encompassing everybody like people that we don't even serve. Um I mean it could be helpful for sales for sure. Um but we haven't cross- checked it. That that is something we can do whenever we we do our final audit. Um, that could be helpful in doing the USPS address format as well. Yep.
Mike Metoyer: So
Alex Mazzei: So basically what I'm hearing is you have the data that you're able to collect and you have two different One addresses. is the the shipping and one is the billing address. And you're using that information as the parent child relationship to set this up as a initial master sheet or master list.
Mike Martin: Right. In dynamics. Yep.
Alex Mazzei: And how confident are you everything that you need like and you're moving in the direction you need? Like what what support or help do you need from us?
 
 
00:13:30
 
Mike Martin: pretty confident because every pretty confident because every every address that comes from Big Commerce is a shipping address.
Alex Mazzei: Okay.
Mike Martin: They don't even denote billing address on their right. um that we did find billing addresses and the only reason I say this is because we found like a good bunch of PO addresses and we don't ship to PO so I'm assuming but those those addresses they might
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, you do have the billing
Mike Martin: but do those those billing addresses don't come over in the integration right so anything that is in Dynamics I can't understand is a shipping address in theory unless they mistakenly put their invoice address as a shipping address, which could happen, I guess. All right, guys. We're back.
Mike Metoyer: Well, and and Kenan, even with that, I would say the customers that do have a billing address, I would say less than 5% of our records, if that, actually use that billing address. Um, most people just use the shipping.
Mike Martin: We're invoicing. Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Uh yeah, for for uh like yeah, like our customers for invoicing.
 
 
00:14:36
 
Mike Martin: Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Yes. Um for sure. Uh specifically because we're not we're not in the 90s anymore where we're not hand mailing these invoices out. Um it's it's typically via email and so they want to actually see what shipping address that the invoice is tied to. Um,
Mike Martin: Gota way to the shipping address because that's what the invoice comes with. But that's what our customer prefers.
Mike Metoyer: So I guess I guess just touching on on So I I is.
Mike Martin: You can pay me and I can throw it in the trash if you want. I'm happy to do that. It'd be faster. But uh I wanted to uh point out that Mike is organizing our data that we pulled um through Big Commerce to kind of um simulate what we want to see in dynamics um pinpointing which ones would be the chains and which ones are their child accounts which are the delivery um addresses. And then the third part of that is creating like a region which as you know Mike like for example Curleaf likes their building per states um that's what we would consider a region but there's other MSOs's that handle their AP across different states but that's the the next step of that.
 
 
00:16:12
 
Mike Martin: So again, just just to recap, so I want to make sure because bringing Mike in, which I didn't have him in involved initially, but understanding he's working on parent child relationships, which kind of all ties into the HubSpot thing, which all ties into the middleware. So, I just want to get on the same page real quick with everybody and again close some dates off and make sure that we're not duplicating each other's work. And especially if he's put in enough time on this, we can run with what he has. Uh or vice versa, if someone else is already putting in time on this, we we just get together and collaborate. So, Alex, I know you had a question for Mike. That's why I went to go grab him. You want to jump back on?
Alex Mazzei: No, I just know that between what he was showing me in his office and some of the Google meets that we had of the data in his Excel spreadsheets, he had a lot of information organized. And I know Kenan and him were working together on that.
 
 
00:17:09
 
Alex Mazzei: And I just wanted him to be in this meeting because I feel like he has the ability that he's understanding what needs to happen, but he's also looking at the information. So when he's looking at it, he knows if it's right or wrong. and and I know Keenan has the back end of the ERP stuff as his skill set. So having both of those people in this meeting was paramount for me.
Mike Martin: So I mean everybody on the line here, everybody understands the parent child relationship. Everybody understands the middleware. Everybody understands what we're trying to get accomplished with dynamics, HubSpot, and Big Commerce. Is there anyone that's on the line that does not understand what we're trying to get accomplished? Then as we move forward, it's going to make sense because I need to know where we're at with timelines. When when's my next deadline? When what what's when's my next action item, deliverable? Where are we at? Meeting today with Straw Bus to review the best way to organize this data in Dynamics.
 
 
00:18:12
 
Mike Martin: Um once we have that methodology, then we can import the clean data that Mike has. Um we'll have to work on a import template for that. Um but once that's established, we should have correct hierarchy. We're also going to have to talk to strus about how we classify those uh regional operators and remove the tree. So I guess by the end of day we can probably have a good idea of how long the system will take based on what they tell us. I'd say so. Yeah. So then once they tell us that what's the next step? Organizing the data. um getting the data set up and in an import template that Kenan can use to upload to dynamics and then subsequent mail file and again I'm the idiot in the room speaking we're doing all this in sandbox. Yes. Right. Everybody understands we're doing all this in sandbox. Okay. So then when's an expectation that this will be done in sandbox, approved in sandbox that we can I can look forward to then moving forward with the other projects or can these other projects be moving simultaneously with this project?
 
 
00:19:18
 
Mike Martin: Right. Where we at with the middleware company? We I sent an email a couple days ago told and told them to hold off for at least a couple weeks. Okay. Why a couple weeks? Why not five days? Why not two days? Why not three days? Because I don't know what the timeline Strauss is going to give us. on or even if they have I don't even know if if they have the current um hierarchy relationship even in dynamics. I don't know they do. So okay. Yeah, it's there. So it could be five days. It could be two weeks. Okay. What what I'm going to say is we probably this meeting is probably premature understanding what I just found out. Probably need to have this meeting after you we have this meeting with Strao. So we're going to put this back on the calendar probably for Monday. That's okay with everybody else. Any other questions I need to understand what Mike?
 
 
00:20:06
 
Mike Martin: Go ahead.
Mike Metoyer: Yeah. So, uh I know you guys are you have a huge focus on uh Dynamics, which obviously that's going to be our source of truth. Uh when we're actually porting it over to HubSpot, um you know, originally uh they uh Instrumental Group was going to use the domain name as far as like uh connecting the accounts um and emails. Um I don't know if that's going to be the best way. So, I I was playing around in HubSpot and there is actually a field where you can input a Bitcommerce customer ID number. Um, and so with that, I don't know if we could uh create a workflow or have Make Web Better import that information from Big Commerce uh before we shut it off just so it's an easy match. Um, but yeah, I just wanted to ask you guys on that. It looks like Danny um is in charge of the workflows on that side.
Mike Martin: So once once an order is created in Big Commerce, it gets pushed to both Dynamics and HubSpot.
 
 
00:21:01
 
Mike Martin: That has to have a unique identifier that that's the same across both platforms, right? So that's the field that you're trying to put into HubSpot. Mike, that unique identifier, how's it being read right now, Mike?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, it's essentially uh Yeah.
Mike Martin: email.
Mike Metoyer: Uh I I don't know. Uh that's a question for Mike Martin. I think he has it uh based on email, the contacts.
Mike Martin: Yeah. Yeah. So uh the the flow goes uh email which goes uh which is a contact and um HubSpot automatically generates uh the primary company associated with the contact as long as it's uh a URL that's readable. So, if it's Mike M at Gmail, then it wouldn't create a uh company associated with Mike Martin because it's a Gmail account. So, there are some scenarios like that in HubSpot, but for the most part, that's how it's set up currently where it's automated by URL uh on the email. How how confident do you guys feel about the organization of the companies in in HubSpot where we can reference that as far as like okay so this company belongs to this chain HubSpot I feel we haven't done a
 
 
00:22:21
 
Mike Metoyer: I don't think we should go that route, but what do you what do you think, Martin?
Mike Martin: lot of hygiene anything that's been done has been automated that's probably going to be accurate but when it's um there are some situations where there's secondary tertiary level like Schwaz is a good example where it's not smart enough to read that and then we've been some people have been doing it by hand where they they have uh uh star buds and then they show primary is schwaz secondary is emeralds fields and they've been kind of just uh dragging and dropping that. So the question we have to ask ourselves is so everything in in Dynamics is driven by company uh billing um and everything pretty much in HubSpot's driven by contact and shipping. So that's where we're going to have to think through how do we combine how how do we merge the data? The origin is always big commerce. So we there should be a unique identifier. Yeah. It's an email right now and that's where problem lies.
 
 
00:23:40
 
Mike Martin: It should be a unique identifier that is a customer ID. It should not be an email or a contact or anything that's going to constantly evolve or change. That's a mistake. It should be ran by some form of customer number. Um and even with that there should be a hierarchy within the customer numbers. You can make your customer numbers however you want. So if I decided that one, two was curleaf, then I've got a hund, you know, 200 stores or whatever after that that I know everything one, two is curleaf, one, two, one is cure leaf one. One, two, two is cure leaf two, one, two, three is curle leaf four. Um, and you can push that all the way out through all of your MSOs through your unique identifiers. Or you can just do them chronologically. Just throw them in, you know, customer one through 10,00. But in either case, in my opinion, that's the way it should be.
Mike Metoyer: So, so how we have it right now is that unique identifier is in the uh the URL up top.
 
 
00:24:38
 
Mike Metoyer: So, for instance, I'm on Guushi's account. uh their bastard account is 13621. So ultimately before we we do this integration with uh dynamics to HubSpot there is a field in HubSpot on this bottom I just added it big commerce customer ID number. So there has to be a workflow where we can get that number and plug it into here. So when we're doing our our our lookup or whatever for Dynamics and our HubSpot customers, it's an automatic match and and we don't have to worry about it. So ideally I would Yeah.
Mike Martin: Who who has this connector right now? Who has the most information on this connector? And whoever's running this connector right now for us is the person that can I mean that's just another addition. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: So based on this make web better, it looks like Danny um was the one that was kind of touching it um last, but this was a couple years ago. This was last year in 2024. So, um I'm not 100% sure.
Mike Martin: Danny, Zach, any input is is adding That field going to be a problem.
 
 
00:25:43
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah, we just uh Go ahead, Danny. But yeah, that's that's what the connection between HubSpot and BigCom is. That's what we use it. We got we have to look into it. So today we can
Daniel Bagaporo: So the thing about that is make web better has its own specific set of parameters that it looks for. I'm looking at its configurations and it looks like that maybe I can I can look around and see what is in there but customer ID sync doesn't seem to be part of its uh automations. For example, um, uh, Matoyer, the, uh, the that Juicy customer ID, what was it again?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, it is going to be 13621.
Daniel Bagaporo: Okay, let me see. So, I'm going to share my screen in just a second here and kind of just uh show you how customer information gets ported over. And I'm going to use Juicy as an example. One second. So what you see right now is kind of like where everything that we see off of make web better.
 
 
00:27:10
 
Daniel Bagaporo: This is how customers are getting synced. It looks like that there are some missing fields here. And I went to go and look at this one in particular. Uh for whatever reason, this is pretty much what shows up in that in that contacts information, right? So, it's not sure where it's reading all of this information, but it's definitely just based off of it's it looks like it's based off of just like the email address. That's where the contact gets sync because email address is common between the customer uh information, the order information and so on, right? to sync off of the uh company ID or the customer group ID. There are two ways about that. The 13621 is the is essentially kind of like what I keep labeling as the BTOC portion of it, but there's also this company ID down here pulled through API which is the B2B uh company ID. So in terms of what to sync from where there are multiple avenues that we can kind of pull that kind of information.
 
 
00:28:19
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Oh wait I let me present sorry. Right. So this is uh so this is the the contact uh the company ID from B TOC 13621 entered up here and the return information is being pulled from the B2B record or API record. So there there are the the one thing that we need to get straight is where are we going to start pulling this information from? Because uh as I explained to Kenan, the original connector was built with B2C in mind, but then we eventually moved on to upgrading to kind of like a B2B environment in Big Commerce. And yeah.
Mike Martin: Yep. We never redesigned it when we start.
Mike Metoyer: What what's what's that line ID uh on number 23? Is that BC uh group ID 1362 something?
Daniel Bagaporo: uh at the top here.
Mike Metoyer: No, it's line 23. 1362. That's interesting.
Daniel Bagaporo: 923. Oh, yeah.
Zach Ungerman: 1362. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: It's missing the one.
Daniel Bagaporo: Looks like that, huh? Let me see. Let me try pulling it up.
 
 
00:29:49
 
Mike Metoyer: And and if we need to do this as a whole group, that's totally cool. If if not, we can do this offline up the meeting just so we don't waste everybody's time.
Daniel Bagaporo: Right.
Mike Martin: And here's the thing. I I I think we probably do need to go offline, but again, my my whole goal of this, I don't want to take everyone's time. It's Friday. Everyone's got a lot of s*** to do. I just want to get some deadlines and some true expectations because what's happening for me is there's all of these projects that are all involved in this one thing that I've just explained to everybody. because they're all bottlenecked at this point. I feel like there's a lot of people going everything's on hold because Keenan wants two weeks and I need to make sure that that isn't the case. And if it is the case that we're doing everything we can in the background in lie of what he's doing and then if we're we've done all that then we're providing all the resources that are necessary to shut this two weeks down to three or four days.
 
 
00:30:45
 
Mike Martin: Okay. Have one more question. Matoyer, do you are you organizing based on HubSpot or any of your other data besides Dynamics um the hierarchy or all the different um delivery addresses for your chains that we can also cross reference
Mike Metoyer: Uh I personally don't have a spreadsheet but uh the best uh location to do that is the B2B app uh in Big Commerce uh because that's where we set parent child accounts and the junior senior buyers.
Mike Martin: Bill can help with that. Okay. Sounds good. Export. I'm wondering if we should do a overarching document that maps how we're uh data hygiene and the cadence of what we're doing. We're going to do this first. We're going to do this second. We're going to do this. Mike is doing it as far as the hierarchy goes. Um I we just and then the order of sequence. Yes. Because Yeah. We're going to have to review that. Yes. Right now I have I'm doing it by uh shipping address from Big Commerce, tying it to the account number and dynamics.
 
 
00:32:01
 
Mike Martin: Yeah. Then tying it back to the customer name and then region and kind of doing a reverse engineer to see if our information is right. What I think would help is that because there's a lot of information that's just in people's heads about customer hierarchies that we don't know that isn't mapped out in dynamics. If Mike, you or the sales team wanted to find out a way to create your own mockup of parent child relationships as far as we have that emerald intel. Perfect. That's 100% correct. Perfect. Then we use that to compare against mine and then we iterate those two and create a decision matrix on what is really the deciding factor. Is it the email shipping address or is it a mixture of both? Which one takes precedence over the other? Right. So what do we need to do to get that done? Uh well the Emerald Intel um did the parent child mapping so that's that's accurate. So and that's a that's a a pivot table spreadsheet.
 
 
00:33:01
 
Mike Martin: Have you seen that? Alex, is that what you shared with me uh last year? Something that Alex worked on.
Alex Mazzei: That that was the CSV. It's a CSV file, but it also has all the customers in the industry, not only their their uh and the the customers. So, it's like a master masterly of all of the parent child relationships based on their um mechanism that they use to identify which ones are parent and child.
Mike Martin: See, that's something we could use on the customer intake side where it's predictive in a sense where if we have a location that we didn't previously have, it would recommend the customer uh setup in dynamics.
Alex Mazzei: And the way I was looking at it was this is the closest
Mike Martin: So I'll take a look at that um distill it down to what our customers are and then do a onetoone match. All right.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, quick question for Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: So we work on that.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, do we have a HubSpot developer environment?
Mike Martin: Yes. I do not believe we do.
 
 
00:34:09
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Because from there, I can probably dig into HubSpot's API capabilities and kind of see what can be pulled from HubSpot and maybe we can find some connections that way.
Mike Martin: Um,
Alex Mazzei: I believe you have a sandbox with the account that you have that you're paying for with HubSpot.
Daniel Bagaporo: Well, maybe because I'm looking to get into its actual developer environment uh where it can like expose web hooks and API calls.
Alex Mazzei: Is that what you're asking?
Mike Martin: We don't have our phone.
Alex Mazzei: Stop. Look at the documentation.
Mike Martin: Yeah, but we don't have the credentials. There is docu There is API documentation for sure and Danny's probably looking at it, but we don't have a a dedicated environment for ourselves. I'm not aware of it anyways.
Daniel Bagaporo: Gotcha.
Mike Martin: All right. Um, so you're going to work on that. You got that Excel sheet. Yeah. Okay. So, you're going to work on that. You're going to meet with Stravo and you're going to get back.
 
 
00:35:08
 
Mike Martin: I need you to put something on the calendar for Monday or Tuesday. Right. So, we have action items there. Alex, can can you update me on this $80,000 or $80,000 this $80,000 part cleanup data cleanup that we were doing in in in HubSpot? I know we we had talked about it and and I don't know if we put any tools in place to kind of scrub it and consolidate. Um, but after talking to Mike here, it sounds like he's as good or if not better than I am in Excel, which means maybe we can have him work on some of that scrub if we haven't done it already. Um, can anyone, whether it's Alex or Matoyer, update me on where we're at with the HubSpot cleanup?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, I I haven't really seen seen too much.
Mike Martin: We haven't done anything.
Alex Mazzei: The only thing that I did was I took the Emerald Intel information and pinned it with the information that I got from the customer table from the dynamics and then once I was getting a confirmation from that I was going to move into if it made sense with the HubSpot and do the same approach but I have to break it down by state because the the information is too much to run with one one sweep.
 
 
00:36:26
 
Mike Martin: So these are the tentacles I'm talking about why it's why I wanted to have this.
Zach Ungerman: Oh, okay.
Mike Martin: So you're working on a project that he he can't move forward until you're done.
Zach Ungerman: So on on Phil by
Mike Martin: Okay. Right. So understanding that puts us in a place where I need you to help me prioritize his time where I get Alex what he needs so I can move this project forward. Okay. So he's going to work on that for you, Alex. He'll get that back to you. He'll put a timet on it after he looks at it. I'll have him send you an email on where we're at with that. Um you're going to set a meeting up. We'll meet again next week. I'm sorry I can't hear you.
Zach Ungerman: by scrub. Uh, do we are we talking about what Martin and the three of us have been talking about for a while? Data hygiene. Is that what we're talking about?
 
 
00:37:14
 
Zach Ungerman: Because we we kind of kind of we've been sitting here talking about data hygiene, but who's doing the data hygiene?
Mike Martin: Yes.
Zach Ungerman: Like, is that Mike?
Alex Mazzei: Hey,
Mike Martin: Literally what we just talked about.
Zach Ungerman: Okay.
Mike Martin: So Mike Mets has a template from Intel uh intelligence, whatever the hell that the third word party.
Zach Ungerman: Mike Mets. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Mike Martin: He's going to match that to his own records for the parent child. We're going to come up with the parent child relationships and through the parent child relationships, he's going to give that back to Alex. Alex is then going to use that as confirmed data and then scrub the rest of it and get rid of all the ones that shouldn't be there and give that back to us. At that point, someone has to then be in charge of uploading it back into HubSpot and getting the act the data loaded. So, who's going to do that? Jim. Sure. Okay. So, I'm on the same page and everyone else here understands. It's in Mike Mets's court right now. It's going to be passed to Alex. Alex then's going to get it to Kenan. Kenan's going to set a meeting on Monday to tell us what Strao said so we can shorten down our timeline and get back to our intel intelligence conversation and build that in. By next Wednesday, everybody should have a lot more clarity. Do I understand this right? Everybody out there, is that your understanding? Danny, Zack, Mike.
Zach Ungerman: Y yeah.
Mike Metoyer: Yep.
Mike Martin: All right, let's go after it, guys.
Mike Metoyer: The only thing I ask is The only thing I ask is before we do any imports uh to HubSpot uh just to verify with me or Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: Let's do it.
Mike Metoyer: But that's it.
Mike Martin: It's got to be done in sandbox and and we got to have a HubSpot sandbox. I don't want to f*** everything up worse than we already have.
Mike Metoyer: Go.
Mike Martin: All right. Anything else?
Daniel Bagaporo: No.

Hubspot and parent child clean up update  - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Mike Metoyer: What up, Alex? I'm good, brother. How you doing?
Alex Mazzei: What's going on?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, as far as uh far as what?
Alex Mazzei: I'm all right. You guys get anywhere like any updates on like things that are moving forward.
Mike Metoyer: Um, so I kind of I haven't really been touching too many IT projects to be honest with you, so I I can't necessarily answer that. I know um HubSpot, I don't know if Zach was involved, but uh Kenan um and IT team I'm assuming um decided to put a little pause on the uh HubSpot project just due to uh cleaning up some uh company records and contacts because he was telling me in Dynamics he might have to create new or different forms to actually plug into Sky Villa um if we even go that route. He was like I was looking at a couple other options too. So, I'm not sure on uh on that piece, but yeah, we can hear a little more from him, but uh I did have something that I I did want to show you and and I could wait uh just to show you before we Yeah.
 
 
00:04:33
 
Mike Metoyer: So, everybody's in the call and they can see what I'm talking about. But, uh as we're cleaning up uh HubSpot just to match dynamics, just some of that data. Uh I actually looked into some of the fields. Um and there's actually a field called Big Commerce customer ID. Um, and so I guess before we we do make this transition to make web better, I was going to see if we could use that uh that middleware software or whatever to actually plug in the Big Commerce ID
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Mike Metoyer: number from the customer um into into HubSpot. I I don't know um if it's an option. Uh I just yeah was playing around with it and wanted to see.
Alex Mazzei: How you doing, Z?
Zach Ungerman: I'm doing well.
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Zach Ungerman: So, just Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, there's a few more people on the meeting, right?
Mike Metoyer: You uh you
Alex Mazzei: So, I I didn't want to go into too much details until we had everybody that were supposed to be on this main.
 
 
00:05:32
 
Alex Mazzei: It was like seven or eight people.
Mike Metoyer: There's a lot of people for sure.
Zach Ungerman: So, most of them are in the office. So, just wait for them to log on before we continue.
Mike Metoyer: Alex, you back home. Where you at? Damn. Okay. Jeez. Hopefully you're getting some good food out there, too.
Mike Martin: It's just Alex is join us. Looks like everybody. How are we doing?
Mike Metoyer: What's up? Good. How you guys doing?
Mike Martin: Good, good, good. How are you?
Zach Ungerman: Good.
Mike Metoyer: Good.
Mike Martin: Look at all those handsome faces, man. Good looking group.
Alex Mazzei: What's up, guys? I'm I'm in transition and there's like spotty uh cellular some.
Mike Martin: All right. Where what city are you in now, Alex?
Alex Mazzei: I don't know. It's Claremont for Mont. I don't know where the hell I am. New Hampshire.
Mike Martin: New Hampshire. All right. All right, guys.
 
 
00:08:28
 
Mike Martin: Well, I don't want to take everyone's time. This is a quick just update for everybody just to make sure we're all on the same page. We've got uh a bunch of things that are all pending each other is the way I'm going to describe it. So, we've got our HubSpot thing that we're dealing with. We have our middleware that we're dealing with. We have um the data cleanup process with the 80,000 uh entries that we've got to clean up. So, with with all of these things that we currently have in the air that are kind of all pending on this particular project, there has been a request from Kenan to to hold off for a little bit. so he can, you know, get some data cleaned up in the system. One of the things because Kenan is new, I want to make sure that everybody here understands holdups and pauses at this point in our project, I want defined and I want him to have all the resources he needs to limit that time. So when I hear two weeks of data, it scares the s*** out of me.
 
 
00:09:29
 
Mike Martin: I want to know what we're doing because you know an analogy that Matoyer gave me I think kind of rings true. We have plumbing and then we've got the water flow that goes in the plumbing and we do need to get this third party company building this out and part of that needs to I think happen at the same time that we're cleaning the data. And so because I'm hearing bits of information from Kenan, a little bit of information from Alex, little bit of information from Mike, I really want to close this gap here today and understand where we are. What are our true deadlines? Are we still on track to hit what we're we've all been talking about, which is 91, and have some true measurement here. Um, and with that, I'll open up the floor to anybody who wants to jump in and either correct me, set me straight, or or tell me everything I just said is accurate and give me some dates.
Alex Mazzei: Is is and Mike Mets with you?
Mike Martin: Mike Mets was invited to this meeting.
 
 
00:10:31
 
Mike Martin: I know he's on the meeting. He's not here, though. He was there. Uh, let me go grab him. I'll go walk over and grab him. I'll be right back. just uh kind of where I'm sitting at.
Alex Mazzei: Thank you.
Mike Martin: We have a meeting with Strawos today on how to better organize the parent child relationship in the system. Currently, we have all the data. It's in the system. However, when sales orders get created in Big Commerce with delivery addresses, those delivery addresses don't live on the customer record themselves. They just live on the sales orders. So, we need that data on um like new sales orders, new delivery addresses to be also applied to the customer record itself. So we have all the data sitting in one place. That's something Diana's and Mike are dealing with too. They're pulling we're pulling the customer data from Dynamics but all the addresses are not there. So we're to manipulate the delivery addresses to kind of uh link them to the correct parent account.
 
 
00:11:19
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah,
Mike Martin: The what's considered the parent account is the invoice account. Uh so that's the top level of it. So assuming that we think there's lower levels to that then we then we can reorganize the the delivery addresses to create chains. Um because right now the current way that we organize it through dynamics it's it's actually like a marketing module but it's it's a manual thing that we have to manually create the chain and all that. It's not efficient. The field is there but it's in the marketing section of the customer record. Got it. But I mean it's it it can live there. That's fine. And we just have to to ident correctly identify each of the company chains to make sure all the MSOs have all of their children underneath that chain. So we have the parent address which is the billing address and then we have the child addresses which are going to be delivery addresses shipping addresses.
Alex Mazzei: Was the the information from Emerald Intel able to help you at all, Kenan?
 
 
00:12:34
 
Mike Martin: We did not even cross check it with that. I mean that that data is important but it's it's all national, you know, that that's kind of encompassing everybody like people that we don't even serve. Um I mean it could be helpful for sales for sure. Um but we haven't cross- checked it. That that is something we can do whenever we we do our final audit. Um, that could be helpful in doing the USPS address format as well. Yep.
Mike Metoyer: So
Alex Mazzei: So basically what I'm hearing is you have the data that you're able to collect and you have two different One addresses. is the the shipping and one is the billing address. And you're using that information as the parent child relationship to set this up as a initial master sheet or master list.
Mike Martin: Right. In dynamics. Yep.
Alex Mazzei: And how confident are you everything that you need like and you're moving in the direction you need? Like what what support or help do you need from us?
 
 
00:13:30
 
Mike Martin: pretty confident because every pretty confident because every every address that comes from Big Commerce is a shipping address.
Alex Mazzei: Okay.
Mike Martin: They don't even denote billing address on their right. um that we did find billing addresses and the only reason I say this is because we found like a good bunch of PO addresses and we don't ship to PO so I'm assuming but those those addresses they might
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, you do have the billing
Mike Martin: but do those those billing addresses don't come over in the integration right so anything that is in Dynamics I can't understand is a shipping address in theory unless they mistakenly put their invoice address as a shipping address, which could happen, I guess. All right, guys. We're back.
Mike Metoyer: Well, and and Kenan, even with that, I would say the customers that do have a billing address, I would say less than 5% of our records, if that, actually use that billing address. Um, most people just use the shipping.
Mike Martin: We're invoicing. Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Uh yeah, for for uh like yeah, like our customers for invoicing.
 
 
00:14:36
 
Mike Martin: Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Yes. Um for sure. Uh specifically because we're not we're not in the 90s anymore where we're not hand mailing these invoices out. Um it's it's typically via email and so they want to actually see what shipping address that the invoice is tied to. Um,
Mike Martin: Gota way to the shipping address because that's what the invoice comes with. But that's what our customer prefers.
Mike Metoyer: So I guess I guess just touching on on So I I is.
Mike Martin: You can pay me and I can throw it in the trash if you want. I'm happy to do that. It'd be faster. But uh I wanted to uh point out that Mike is organizing our data that we pulled um through Big Commerce to kind of um simulate what we want to see in dynamics um pinpointing which ones would be the chains and which ones are their child accounts which are the delivery um addresses. And then the third part of that is creating like a region which as you know Mike like for example Curleaf likes their building per states um that's what we would consider a region but there's other MSOs's that handle their AP across different states but that's the the next step of that.
 
 
00:16:12
 
Mike Martin: So again, just just to recap, so I want to make sure because bringing Mike in, which I didn't have him in involved initially, but understanding he's working on parent child relationships, which kind of all ties into the HubSpot thing, which all ties into the middleware. So, I just want to get on the same page real quick with everybody and again close some dates off and make sure that we're not duplicating each other's work. And especially if he's put in enough time on this, we can run with what he has. Uh or vice versa, if someone else is already putting in time on this, we we just get together and collaborate. So, Alex, I know you had a question for Mike. That's why I went to go grab him. You want to jump back on?
Alex Mazzei: No, I just know that between what he was showing me in his office and some of the Google meets that we had of the data in his Excel spreadsheets, he had a lot of information organized. And I know Kenan and him were working together on that.
 
 
00:17:09
 
Alex Mazzei: And I just wanted him to be in this meeting because I feel like he has the ability that he's understanding what needs to happen, but he's also looking at the information. So when he's looking at it, he knows if it's right or wrong. and and I know Keenan has the back end of the ERP stuff as his skill set. So having both of those people in this meeting was paramount for me.
Mike Martin: So I mean everybody on the line here, everybody understands the parent child relationship. Everybody understands the middleware. Everybody understands what we're trying to get accomplished with dynamics, HubSpot, and Big Commerce. Is there anyone that's on the line that does not understand what we're trying to get accomplished? Then as we move forward, it's going to make sense because I need to know where we're at with timelines. When when's my next deadline? When what what's when's my next action item, deliverable? Where are we at? Meeting today with Straw Bus to review the best way to organize this data in Dynamics.
 
 
00:18:12
 
Mike Martin: Um once we have that methodology, then we can import the clean data that Mike has. Um we'll have to work on a import template for that. Um but once that's established, we should have correct hierarchy. We're also going to have to talk to strus about how we classify those uh regional operators and remove the tree. So I guess by the end of day we can probably have a good idea of how long the system will take based on what they tell us. I'd say so. Yeah. So then once they tell us that what's the next step? Organizing the data. um getting the data set up and in an import template that Kenan can use to upload to dynamics and then subsequent mail file and again I'm the idiot in the room speaking we're doing all this in sandbox. Yes. Right. Everybody understands we're doing all this in sandbox. Okay. So then when's an expectation that this will be done in sandbox, approved in sandbox that we can I can look forward to then moving forward with the other projects or can these other projects be moving simultaneously with this project?
 
 
00:19:18
 
Mike Martin: Right. Where we at with the middleware company? We I sent an email a couple days ago told and told them to hold off for at least a couple weeks. Okay. Why a couple weeks? Why not five days? Why not two days? Why not three days? Because I don't know what the timeline Strauss is going to give us. on or even if they have I don't even know if if they have the current um hierarchy relationship even in dynamics. I don't know they do. So okay. Yeah, it's there. So it could be five days. It could be two weeks. Okay. What what I'm going to say is we probably this meeting is probably premature understanding what I just found out. Probably need to have this meeting after you we have this meeting with Strao. So we're going to put this back on the calendar probably for Monday. That's okay with everybody else. Any other questions I need to understand what Mike?
 
 
00:20:06
 
Mike Martin: Go ahead.
Mike Metoyer: Yeah. So, uh I know you guys are you have a huge focus on uh Dynamics, which obviously that's going to be our source of truth. Uh when we're actually porting it over to HubSpot, um you know, originally uh they uh Instrumental Group was going to use the domain name as far as like uh connecting the accounts um and emails. Um I don't know if that's going to be the best way. So, I I was playing around in HubSpot and there is actually a field where you can input a Bitcommerce customer ID number. Um, and so with that, I don't know if we could uh create a workflow or have Make Web Better import that information from Big Commerce uh before we shut it off just so it's an easy match. Um, but yeah, I just wanted to ask you guys on that. It looks like Danny um is in charge of the workflows on that side.
Mike Martin: So once once an order is created in Big Commerce, it gets pushed to both Dynamics and HubSpot.
 
 
00:21:01
 
Mike Martin: That has to have a unique identifier that that's the same across both platforms, right? So that's the field that you're trying to put into HubSpot. Mike, that unique identifier, how's it being read right now, Mike?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, it's essentially uh Yeah.
Mike Martin: email.
Mike Metoyer: Uh I I don't know. Uh that's a question for Mike Martin. I think he has it uh based on email, the contacts.
Mike Martin: Yeah. Yeah. So uh the the flow goes uh email which goes uh which is a contact and um HubSpot automatically generates uh the primary company associated with the contact as long as it's uh a URL that's readable. So, if it's Mike M at Gmail, then it wouldn't create a uh company associated with Mike Martin because it's a Gmail account. So, there are some scenarios like that in HubSpot, but for the most part, that's how it's set up currently where it's automated by URL uh on the email. How how confident do you guys feel about the organization of the companies in in HubSpot where we can reference that as far as like okay so this company belongs to this chain HubSpot I feel we haven't done a
 
 
00:22:21
 
Mike Metoyer: I don't think we should go that route, but what do you what do you think, Martin?
Mike Martin: lot of hygiene anything that's been done has been automated that's probably going to be accurate but when it's um there are some situations where there's secondary tertiary level like Schwaz is a good example where it's not smart enough to read that and then we've been some people have been doing it by hand where they they have uh uh star buds and then they show primary is schwaz secondary is emeralds fields and they've been kind of just uh dragging and dropping that. So the question we have to ask ourselves is so everything in in Dynamics is driven by company uh billing um and everything pretty much in HubSpot's driven by contact and shipping. So that's where we're going to have to think through how do we combine how how do we merge the data? The origin is always big commerce. So we there should be a unique identifier. Yeah. It's an email right now and that's where problem lies.
 
 
00:23:40
 
Mike Martin: It should be a unique identifier that is a customer ID. It should not be an email or a contact or anything that's going to constantly evolve or change. That's a mistake. It should be ran by some form of customer number. Um and even with that there should be a hierarchy within the customer numbers. You can make your customer numbers however you want. So if I decided that one, two was curleaf, then I've got a hund, you know, 200 stores or whatever after that that I know everything one, two is curleaf, one, two, one is cure leaf one. One, two, two is cure leaf two, one, two, three is curle leaf four. Um, and you can push that all the way out through all of your MSOs through your unique identifiers. Or you can just do them chronologically. Just throw them in, you know, customer one through 10,00. But in either case, in my opinion, that's the way it should be.
Mike Metoyer: So, so how we have it right now is that unique identifier is in the uh the URL up top.
 
 
00:24:38
 
Mike Metoyer: So, for instance, I'm on Guushi's account. uh their bastard account is 13621. So ultimately before we we do this integration with uh dynamics to HubSpot there is a field in HubSpot on this bottom I just added it big commerce customer ID number. So there has to be a workflow where we can get that number and plug it into here. So when we're doing our our our lookup or whatever for Dynamics and our HubSpot customers, it's an automatic match and and we don't have to worry about it. So ideally I would Yeah.
Mike Martin: Who who has this connector right now? Who has the most information on this connector? And whoever's running this connector right now for us is the person that can I mean that's just another addition. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: So based on this make web better, it looks like Danny um was the one that was kind of touching it um last, but this was a couple years ago. This was last year in 2024. So, um I'm not 100% sure.
Mike Martin: Danny, Zach, any input is is adding That field going to be a problem.
 
 
00:25:43
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah, we just uh Go ahead, Danny. But yeah, that's that's what the connection between HubSpot and BigCom is. That's what we use it. We got we have to look into it. So today we can
Daniel Bagaporo: So the thing about that is make web better has its own specific set of parameters that it looks for. I'm looking at its configurations and it looks like that maybe I can I can look around and see what is in there but customer ID sync doesn't seem to be part of its uh automations. For example, um, uh, Matoyer, the, uh, the that Juicy customer ID, what was it again?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, it is going to be 13621.
Daniel Bagaporo: Okay, let me see. So, I'm going to share my screen in just a second here and kind of just uh show you how customer information gets ported over. And I'm going to use Juicy as an example. One second. So what you see right now is kind of like where everything that we see off of make web better.
 
 
00:27:10
 
Daniel Bagaporo: This is how customers are getting synced. It looks like that there are some missing fields here. And I went to go and look at this one in particular. Uh for whatever reason, this is pretty much what shows up in that in that contacts information, right? So, it's not sure where it's reading all of this information, but it's definitely just based off of it's it looks like it's based off of just like the email address. That's where the contact gets sync because email address is common between the customer uh information, the order information and so on, right? to sync off of the uh company ID or the customer group ID. There are two ways about that. The 13621 is the is essentially kind of like what I keep labeling as the BTOC portion of it, but there's also this company ID down here pulled through API which is the B2B uh company ID. So in terms of what to sync from where there are multiple avenues that we can kind of pull that kind of information.
 
 
00:28:19
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Oh wait I let me present sorry. Right. So this is uh so this is the the contact uh the company ID from B TOC 13621 entered up here and the return information is being pulled from the B2B record or API record. So there there are the the one thing that we need to get straight is where are we going to start pulling this information from? Because uh as I explained to Kenan, the original connector was built with B2C in mind, but then we eventually moved on to upgrading to kind of like a B2B environment in Big Commerce. And yeah.
Mike Martin: Yep. We never redesigned it when we start.
Mike Metoyer: What what's what's that line ID uh on number 23? Is that BC uh group ID 1362 something?
Daniel Bagaporo: uh at the top here.
Mike Metoyer: No, it's line 23. 1362. That's interesting.
Daniel Bagaporo: 923. Oh, yeah.
Zach Ungerman: 1362. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: It's missing the one.
Daniel Bagaporo: Looks like that, huh? Let me see. Let me try pulling it up.
 
 
00:29:49
 
Mike Metoyer: And and if we need to do this as a whole group, that's totally cool. If if not, we can do this offline up the meeting just so we don't waste everybody's time.
Daniel Bagaporo: Right.
Mike Martin: And here's the thing. I I I think we probably do need to go offline, but again, my my whole goal of this, I don't want to take everyone's time. It's Friday. Everyone's got a lot of s*** to do. I just want to get some deadlines and some true expectations because what's happening for me is there's all of these projects that are all involved in this one thing that I've just explained to everybody. because they're all bottlenecked at this point. I feel like there's a lot of people going everything's on hold because Keenan wants two weeks and I need to make sure that that isn't the case. And if it is the case that we're doing everything we can in the background in lie of what he's doing and then if we're we've done all that then we're providing all the resources that are necessary to shut this two weeks down to three or four days.
 
 
00:30:45
 
Mike Martin: Okay. Have one more question. Matoyer, do you are you organizing based on HubSpot or any of your other data besides Dynamics um the hierarchy or all the different um delivery addresses for your chains that we can also cross reference
Mike Metoyer: Uh I personally don't have a spreadsheet but uh the best uh location to do that is the B2B app uh in Big Commerce uh because that's where we set parent child accounts and the junior senior buyers.
Mike Martin: Bill can help with that. Okay. Sounds good. Export. I'm wondering if we should do a overarching document that maps how we're uh data hygiene and the cadence of what we're doing. We're going to do this first. We're going to do this second. We're going to do this. Mike is doing it as far as the hierarchy goes. Um I we just and then the order of sequence. Yes. Because Yeah. We're going to have to review that. Yes. Right now I have I'm doing it by uh shipping address from Big Commerce, tying it to the account number and dynamics.
 
 
00:32:01
 
Mike Martin: Yeah. Then tying it back to the customer name and then region and kind of doing a reverse engineer to see if our information is right. What I think would help is that because there's a lot of information that's just in people's heads about customer hierarchies that we don't know that isn't mapped out in dynamics. If Mike, you or the sales team wanted to find out a way to create your own mockup of parent child relationships as far as we have that emerald intel. Perfect. That's 100% correct. Perfect. Then we use that to compare against mine and then we iterate those two and create a decision matrix on what is really the deciding factor. Is it the email shipping address or is it a mixture of both? Which one takes precedence over the other? Right. So what do we need to do to get that done? Uh well the Emerald Intel um did the parent child mapping so that's that's accurate. So and that's a that's a a pivot table spreadsheet.
 
 
00:33:01
 
Mike Martin: Have you seen that? Alex, is that what you shared with me uh last year? Something that Alex worked on.
Alex Mazzei: That that was the CSV. It's a CSV file, but it also has all the customers in the industry, not only their their uh and the the customers. So, it's like a master masterly of all of the parent child relationships based on their um mechanism that they use to identify which ones are parent and child.
Mike Martin: See, that's something we could use on the customer intake side where it's predictive in a sense where if we have a location that we didn't previously have, it would recommend the customer uh setup in dynamics.
Alex Mazzei: And the way I was looking at it was this is the closest
Mike Martin: So I'll take a look at that um distill it down to what our customers are and then do a onetoone match. All right.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, quick question for Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: So we work on that.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, do we have a HubSpot developer environment?
Mike Martin: Yes. I do not believe we do.
 
 
00:34:09
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Because from there, I can probably dig into HubSpot's API capabilities and kind of see what can be pulled from HubSpot and maybe we can find some connections that way.
Mike Martin: Um,
Alex Mazzei: I believe you have a sandbox with the account that you have that you're paying for with HubSpot.
Daniel Bagaporo: Well, maybe because I'm looking to get into its actual developer environment uh where it can like expose web hooks and API calls.
Alex Mazzei: Is that what you're asking?
Mike Martin: We don't have our phone.
Alex Mazzei: Stop. Look at the documentation.
Mike Martin: Yeah, but we don't have the credentials. There is docu There is API documentation for sure and Danny's probably looking at it, but we don't have a a dedicated environment for ourselves. I'm not aware of it anyways.
Daniel Bagaporo: Gotcha.
Mike Martin: All right. Um, so you're going to work on that. You got that Excel sheet. Yeah. Okay. So, you're going to work on that. You're going to meet with Stravo and you're going to get back.
 
 
00:35:08
 
Mike Martin: I need you to put something on the calendar for Monday or Tuesday. Right. So, we have action items there. Alex, can can you update me on this $80,000 or $80,000 this $80,000 part cleanup data cleanup that we were doing in in in HubSpot? I know we we had talked about it and and I don't know if we put any tools in place to kind of scrub it and consolidate. Um, but after talking to Mike here, it sounds like he's as good or if not better than I am in Excel, which means maybe we can have him work on some of that scrub if we haven't done it already. Um, can anyone, whether it's Alex or Matoyer, update me on where we're at with the HubSpot cleanup?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, I I haven't really seen seen too much.
Mike Martin: We haven't done anything.
Alex Mazzei: The only thing that I did was I took the Emerald Intel information and pinned it with the information that I got from the customer table from the dynamics and then once I was getting a confirmation from that I was going to move into if it made sense with the HubSpot and do the same approach but I have to break it down by state because the the information is too much to run with one one sweep.
 
 
00:36:26
 
Mike Martin: So these are the tentacles I'm talking about why it's why I wanted to have this.
Zach Ungerman: Oh, okay.
Mike Martin: So you're working on a project that he he can't move forward until you're done.
Zach Ungerman: So on on Phil by
Mike Martin: Okay. Right. So understanding that puts us in a place where I need you to help me prioritize his time where I get Alex what he needs so I can move this project forward. Okay. So he's going to work on that for you, Alex. He'll get that back to you. He'll put a timet on it after he looks at it. I'll have him send you an email on where we're at with that. Um you're going to set a meeting up. We'll meet again next week. I'm sorry I can't hear you.
Zach Ungerman: by scrub. Uh, do we are we talking about what Martin and the three of us have been talking about for a while? Data hygiene. Is that what we're talking about?
 
 
00:37:14
 
Zach Ungerman: Because we we kind of kind of we've been sitting here talking about data hygiene, but who's doing the data hygiene?
Mike Martin: Yes.
Zach Ungerman: Like, is that Mike?
Alex Mazzei: Hey,
Mike Martin: Literally what we just talked about.
Zach Ungerman: Okay.
Mike Martin: So Mike Mets has a template from Intel uh intelligence, whatever the hell that the third word party.
Zach Ungerman: Mike Mets. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Mike Martin: He's going to match that to his own records for the parent child. We're going to come up with the parent child relationships and through the parent child relationships, he's going to give that back to Alex. Alex is then going to use that as confirmed data and then scrub the rest of it and get rid of all the ones that shouldn't be there and give that back to us. At that point, someone has to then be in charge of uploading it back into HubSpot and getting the act the data loaded. So, who's going to do that? Jim. Sure. Okay. So, I'm on the same page and everyone else here understands. It's in Mike Mets's court right now. It's going to be passed to Alex. Alex then's going to get it to Kenan. Kenan's going to set a meeting on Monday to tell us what Strao said so we can shorten down our timeline and get back to our intel intelligence conversation and build that in. By next Wednesday, everybody should have a lot more clarity. Do I understand this right? Everybody out there, is that your understanding? Danny, Zack, Mike.
Zach Ungerman: Y yeah.
Mike Metoyer: Yep.
Mike Martin: All right, let's go after it, guys.
Mike Metoyer: The only thing I ask is The only thing I ask is before we do any imports uh to HubSpot uh just to verify with me or Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: Let's do it.
Mike Metoyer: But that's it.
Mike Martin: It's got to be done in sandbox and and we got to have a HubSpot sandbox. I don't want to f*** everything up worse than we already have.
Mike Metoyer: Go.
Mike Martin: All right. Anything else?
Daniel Bagaporo: No.

Hubspot and parent child clean up update  - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Mike Metoyer: What up, Alex? I'm good, brother. How you doing?
Alex Mazzei: What's going on?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, as far as uh far as what?
Alex Mazzei: I'm all right. You guys get anywhere like any updates on like things that are moving forward.
Mike Metoyer: Um, so I kind of I haven't really been touching too many IT projects to be honest with you, so I I can't necessarily answer that. I know um HubSpot, I don't know if Zach was involved, but uh Kenan um and IT team I'm assuming um decided to put a little pause on the uh HubSpot project just due to uh cleaning up some uh company records and contacts because he was telling me in Dynamics he might have to create new or different forms to actually plug into Sky Villa um if we even go that route. He was like I was looking at a couple other options too. So, I'm not sure on uh on that piece, but yeah, we can hear a little more from him, but uh I did have something that I I did want to show you and and I could wait uh just to show you before we Yeah.
 
 
00:04:33
 
Mike Metoyer: So, everybody's in the call and they can see what I'm talking about. But, uh as we're cleaning up uh HubSpot just to match dynamics, just some of that data. Uh I actually looked into some of the fields. Um and there's actually a field called Big Commerce customer ID. Um, and so I guess before we we do make this transition to make web better, I was going to see if we could use that uh that middleware software or whatever to actually plug in the Big Commerce ID
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Mike Metoyer: number from the customer um into into HubSpot. I I don't know um if it's an option. Uh I just yeah was playing around with it and wanted to see.
Alex Mazzei: How you doing, Z?
Zach Ungerman: I'm doing well.
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Zach Ungerman: So, just Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, there's a few more people on the meeting, right?
Mike Metoyer: You uh you
Alex Mazzei: So, I I didn't want to go into too much details until we had everybody that were supposed to be on this main.
 
 
00:05:32
 
Alex Mazzei: It was like seven or eight people.
Mike Metoyer: There's a lot of people for sure.
Zach Ungerman: So, most of them are in the office. So, just wait for them to log on before we continue.
Mike Metoyer: Alex, you back home. Where you at? Damn. Okay. Jeez. Hopefully you're getting some good food out there, too.
Mike Martin: It's just Alex is join us. Looks like everybody. How are we doing?
Mike Metoyer: What's up? Good. How you guys doing?
Mike Martin: Good, good, good. How are you?
Zach Ungerman: Good.
Mike Metoyer: Good.
Mike Martin: Look at all those handsome faces, man. Good looking group.
Alex Mazzei: What's up, guys? I'm I'm in transition and there's like spotty uh cellular some.
Mike Martin: All right. Where what city are you in now, Alex?
Alex Mazzei: I don't know. It's Claremont for Mont. I don't know where the hell I am. New Hampshire.
Mike Martin: New Hampshire. All right. All right, guys.
 
 
00:08:28
 
Mike Martin: Well, I don't want to take everyone's time. This is a quick just update for everybody just to make sure we're all on the same page. We've got uh a bunch of things that are all pending each other is the way I'm going to describe it. So, we've got our HubSpot thing that we're dealing with. We have our middleware that we're dealing with. We have um the data cleanup process with the 80,000 uh entries that we've got to clean up. So, with with all of these things that we currently have in the air that are kind of all pending on this particular project, there has been a request from Kenan to to hold off for a little bit. so he can, you know, get some data cleaned up in the system. One of the things because Kenan is new, I want to make sure that everybody here understands holdups and pauses at this point in our project, I want defined and I want him to have all the resources he needs to limit that time. So when I hear two weeks of data, it scares the s*** out of me.
 
 
00:09:29
 
Mike Martin: I want to know what we're doing because you know an analogy that Matoyer gave me I think kind of rings true. We have plumbing and then we've got the water flow that goes in the plumbing and we do need to get this third party company building this out and part of that needs to I think happen at the same time that we're cleaning the data. And so because I'm hearing bits of information from Kenan, a little bit of information from Alex, little bit of information from Mike, I really want to close this gap here today and understand where we are. What are our true deadlines? Are we still on track to hit what we're we've all been talking about, which is 91, and have some true measurement here. Um, and with that, I'll open up the floor to anybody who wants to jump in and either correct me, set me straight, or or tell me everything I just said is accurate and give me some dates.
Alex Mazzei: Is is and Mike Mets with you?
Mike Martin: Mike Mets was invited to this meeting.
 
 
00:10:31
 
Mike Martin: I know he's on the meeting. He's not here, though. He was there. Uh, let me go grab him. I'll go walk over and grab him. I'll be right back. just uh kind of where I'm sitting at.
Alex Mazzei: Thank you.
Mike Martin: We have a meeting with Strawos today on how to better organize the parent child relationship in the system. Currently, we have all the data. It's in the system. However, when sales orders get created in Big Commerce with delivery addresses, those delivery addresses don't live on the customer record themselves. They just live on the sales orders. So, we need that data on um like new sales orders, new delivery addresses to be also applied to the customer record itself. So we have all the data sitting in one place. That's something Diana's and Mike are dealing with too. They're pulling we're pulling the customer data from Dynamics but all the addresses are not there. So we're to manipulate the delivery addresses to kind of uh link them to the correct parent account.
 
 
00:11:19
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah,
Mike Martin: The what's considered the parent account is the invoice account. Uh so that's the top level of it. So assuming that we think there's lower levels to that then we then we can reorganize the the delivery addresses to create chains. Um because right now the current way that we organize it through dynamics it's it's actually like a marketing module but it's it's a manual thing that we have to manually create the chain and all that. It's not efficient. The field is there but it's in the marketing section of the customer record. Got it. But I mean it's it it can live there. That's fine. And we just have to to ident correctly identify each of the company chains to make sure all the MSOs have all of their children underneath that chain. So we have the parent address which is the billing address and then we have the child addresses which are going to be delivery addresses shipping addresses.
Alex Mazzei: Was the the information from Emerald Intel able to help you at all, Kenan?
 
 
00:12:34
 
Mike Martin: We did not even cross check it with that. I mean that that data is important but it's it's all national, you know, that that's kind of encompassing everybody like people that we don't even serve. Um I mean it could be helpful for sales for sure. Um but we haven't cross- checked it. That that is something we can do whenever we we do our final audit. Um, that could be helpful in doing the USPS address format as well. Yep.
Mike Metoyer: So
Alex Mazzei: So basically what I'm hearing is you have the data that you're able to collect and you have two different One addresses. is the the shipping and one is the billing address. And you're using that information as the parent child relationship to set this up as a initial master sheet or master list.
Mike Martin: Right. In dynamics. Yep.
Alex Mazzei: And how confident are you everything that you need like and you're moving in the direction you need? Like what what support or help do you need from us?
 
 
00:13:30
 
Mike Martin: pretty confident because every pretty confident because every every address that comes from Big Commerce is a shipping address.
Alex Mazzei: Okay.
Mike Martin: They don't even denote billing address on their right. um that we did find billing addresses and the only reason I say this is because we found like a good bunch of PO addresses and we don't ship to PO so I'm assuming but those those addresses they might
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, you do have the billing
Mike Martin: but do those those billing addresses don't come over in the integration right so anything that is in Dynamics I can't understand is a shipping address in theory unless they mistakenly put their invoice address as a shipping address, which could happen, I guess. All right, guys. We're back.
Mike Metoyer: Well, and and Kenan, even with that, I would say the customers that do have a billing address, I would say less than 5% of our records, if that, actually use that billing address. Um, most people just use the shipping.
Mike Martin: We're invoicing. Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Uh yeah, for for uh like yeah, like our customers for invoicing.
 
 
00:14:36
 
Mike Martin: Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Yes. Um for sure. Uh specifically because we're not we're not in the 90s anymore where we're not hand mailing these invoices out. Um it's it's typically via email and so they want to actually see what shipping address that the invoice is tied to. Um,
Mike Martin: Gota way to the shipping address because that's what the invoice comes with. But that's what our customer prefers.
Mike Metoyer: So I guess I guess just touching on on So I I is.
Mike Martin: You can pay me and I can throw it in the trash if you want. I'm happy to do that. It'd be faster. But uh I wanted to uh point out that Mike is organizing our data that we pulled um through Big Commerce to kind of um simulate what we want to see in dynamics um pinpointing which ones would be the chains and which ones are their child accounts which are the delivery um addresses. And then the third part of that is creating like a region which as you know Mike like for example Curleaf likes their building per states um that's what we would consider a region but there's other MSOs's that handle their AP across different states but that's the the next step of that.
 
 
00:16:12
 
Mike Martin: So again, just just to recap, so I want to make sure because bringing Mike in, which I didn't have him in involved initially, but understanding he's working on parent child relationships, which kind of all ties into the HubSpot thing, which all ties into the middleware. So, I just want to get on the same page real quick with everybody and again close some dates off and make sure that we're not duplicating each other's work. And especially if he's put in enough time on this, we can run with what he has. Uh or vice versa, if someone else is already putting in time on this, we we just get together and collaborate. So, Alex, I know you had a question for Mike. That's why I went to go grab him. You want to jump back on?
Alex Mazzei: No, I just know that between what he was showing me in his office and some of the Google meets that we had of the data in his Excel spreadsheets, he had a lot of information organized. And I know Kenan and him were working together on that.
 
 
00:17:09
 
Alex Mazzei: And I just wanted him to be in this meeting because I feel like he has the ability that he's understanding what needs to happen, but he's also looking at the information. So when he's looking at it, he knows if it's right or wrong. and and I know Keenan has the back end of the ERP stuff as his skill set. So having both of those people in this meeting was paramount for me.
Mike Martin: So I mean everybody on the line here, everybody understands the parent child relationship. Everybody understands the middleware. Everybody understands what we're trying to get accomplished with dynamics, HubSpot, and Big Commerce. Is there anyone that's on the line that does not understand what we're trying to get accomplished? Then as we move forward, it's going to make sense because I need to know where we're at with timelines. When when's my next deadline? When what what's when's my next action item, deliverable? Where are we at? Meeting today with Straw Bus to review the best way to organize this data in Dynamics.
 
 
00:18:12
 
Mike Martin: Um once we have that methodology, then we can import the clean data that Mike has. Um we'll have to work on a import template for that. Um but once that's established, we should have correct hierarchy. We're also going to have to talk to strus about how we classify those uh regional operators and remove the tree. So I guess by the end of day we can probably have a good idea of how long the system will take based on what they tell us. I'd say so. Yeah. So then once they tell us that what's the next step? Organizing the data. um getting the data set up and in an import template that Kenan can use to upload to dynamics and then subsequent mail file and again I'm the idiot in the room speaking we're doing all this in sandbox. Yes. Right. Everybody understands we're doing all this in sandbox. Okay. So then when's an expectation that this will be done in sandbox, approved in sandbox that we can I can look forward to then moving forward with the other projects or can these other projects be moving simultaneously with this project?
 
 
00:19:18
 
Mike Martin: Right. Where we at with the middleware company? We I sent an email a couple days ago told and told them to hold off for at least a couple weeks. Okay. Why a couple weeks? Why not five days? Why not two days? Why not three days? Because I don't know what the timeline Strauss is going to give us. on or even if they have I don't even know if if they have the current um hierarchy relationship even in dynamics. I don't know they do. So okay. Yeah, it's there. So it could be five days. It could be two weeks. Okay. What what I'm going to say is we probably this meeting is probably premature understanding what I just found out. Probably need to have this meeting after you we have this meeting with Strao. So we're going to put this back on the calendar probably for Monday. That's okay with everybody else. Any other questions I need to understand what Mike?
 
 
00:20:06
 
Mike Martin: Go ahead.
Mike Metoyer: Yeah. So, uh I know you guys are you have a huge focus on uh Dynamics, which obviously that's going to be our source of truth. Uh when we're actually porting it over to HubSpot, um you know, originally uh they uh Instrumental Group was going to use the domain name as far as like uh connecting the accounts um and emails. Um I don't know if that's going to be the best way. So, I I was playing around in HubSpot and there is actually a field where you can input a Bitcommerce customer ID number. Um, and so with that, I don't know if we could uh create a workflow or have Make Web Better import that information from Big Commerce uh before we shut it off just so it's an easy match. Um, but yeah, I just wanted to ask you guys on that. It looks like Danny um is in charge of the workflows on that side.
Mike Martin: So once once an order is created in Big Commerce, it gets pushed to both Dynamics and HubSpot.
 
 
00:21:01
 
Mike Martin: That has to have a unique identifier that that's the same across both platforms, right? So that's the field that you're trying to put into HubSpot. Mike, that unique identifier, how's it being read right now, Mike?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, it's essentially uh Yeah.
Mike Martin: email.
Mike Metoyer: Uh I I don't know. Uh that's a question for Mike Martin. I think he has it uh based on email, the contacts.
Mike Martin: Yeah. Yeah. So uh the the flow goes uh email which goes uh which is a contact and um HubSpot automatically generates uh the primary company associated with the contact as long as it's uh a URL that's readable. So, if it's Mike M at Gmail, then it wouldn't create a uh company associated with Mike Martin because it's a Gmail account. So, there are some scenarios like that in HubSpot, but for the most part, that's how it's set up currently where it's automated by URL uh on the email. How how confident do you guys feel about the organization of the companies in in HubSpot where we can reference that as far as like okay so this company belongs to this chain HubSpot I feel we haven't done a
 
 
00:22:21
 
Mike Metoyer: I don't think we should go that route, but what do you what do you think, Martin?
Mike Martin: lot of hygiene anything that's been done has been automated that's probably going to be accurate but when it's um there are some situations where there's secondary tertiary level like Schwaz is a good example where it's not smart enough to read that and then we've been some people have been doing it by hand where they they have uh uh star buds and then they show primary is schwaz secondary is emeralds fields and they've been kind of just uh dragging and dropping that. So the question we have to ask ourselves is so everything in in Dynamics is driven by company uh billing um and everything pretty much in HubSpot's driven by contact and shipping. So that's where we're going to have to think through how do we combine how how do we merge the data? The origin is always big commerce. So we there should be a unique identifier. Yeah. It's an email right now and that's where problem lies.
 
 
00:23:40
 
Mike Martin: It should be a unique identifier that is a customer ID. It should not be an email or a contact or anything that's going to constantly evolve or change. That's a mistake. It should be ran by some form of customer number. Um and even with that there should be a hierarchy within the customer numbers. You can make your customer numbers however you want. So if I decided that one, two was curleaf, then I've got a hund, you know, 200 stores or whatever after that that I know everything one, two is curleaf, one, two, one is cure leaf one. One, two, two is cure leaf two, one, two, three is curle leaf four. Um, and you can push that all the way out through all of your MSOs through your unique identifiers. Or you can just do them chronologically. Just throw them in, you know, customer one through 10,00. But in either case, in my opinion, that's the way it should be.
Mike Metoyer: So, so how we have it right now is that unique identifier is in the uh the URL up top.
 
 
00:24:38
 
Mike Metoyer: So, for instance, I'm on Guushi's account. uh their bastard account is 13621. So ultimately before we we do this integration with uh dynamics to HubSpot there is a field in HubSpot on this bottom I just added it big commerce customer ID number. So there has to be a workflow where we can get that number and plug it into here. So when we're doing our our our lookup or whatever for Dynamics and our HubSpot customers, it's an automatic match and and we don't have to worry about it. So ideally I would Yeah.
Mike Martin: Who who has this connector right now? Who has the most information on this connector? And whoever's running this connector right now for us is the person that can I mean that's just another addition. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: So based on this make web better, it looks like Danny um was the one that was kind of touching it um last, but this was a couple years ago. This was last year in 2024. So, um I'm not 100% sure.
Mike Martin: Danny, Zach, any input is is adding That field going to be a problem.
 
 
00:25:43
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah, we just uh Go ahead, Danny. But yeah, that's that's what the connection between HubSpot and BigCom is. That's what we use it. We got we have to look into it. So today we can
Daniel Bagaporo: So the thing about that is make web better has its own specific set of parameters that it looks for. I'm looking at its configurations and it looks like that maybe I can I can look around and see what is in there but customer ID sync doesn't seem to be part of its uh automations. For example, um, uh, Matoyer, the, uh, the that Juicy customer ID, what was it again?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, it is going to be 13621.
Daniel Bagaporo: Okay, let me see. So, I'm going to share my screen in just a second here and kind of just uh show you how customer information gets ported over. And I'm going to use Juicy as an example. One second. So what you see right now is kind of like where everything that we see off of make web better.
 
 
00:27:10
 
Daniel Bagaporo: This is how customers are getting synced. It looks like that there are some missing fields here. And I went to go and look at this one in particular. Uh for whatever reason, this is pretty much what shows up in that in that contacts information, right? So, it's not sure where it's reading all of this information, but it's definitely just based off of it's it looks like it's based off of just like the email address. That's where the contact gets sync because email address is common between the customer uh information, the order information and so on, right? to sync off of the uh company ID or the customer group ID. There are two ways about that. The 13621 is the is essentially kind of like what I keep labeling as the BTOC portion of it, but there's also this company ID down here pulled through API which is the B2B uh company ID. So in terms of what to sync from where there are multiple avenues that we can kind of pull that kind of information.
 
 
00:28:19
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Oh wait I let me present sorry. Right. So this is uh so this is the the contact uh the company ID from B TOC 13621 entered up here and the return information is being pulled from the B2B record or API record. So there there are the the one thing that we need to get straight is where are we going to start pulling this information from? Because uh as I explained to Kenan, the original connector was built with B2C in mind, but then we eventually moved on to upgrading to kind of like a B2B environment in Big Commerce. And yeah.
Mike Martin: Yep. We never redesigned it when we start.
Mike Metoyer: What what's what's that line ID uh on number 23? Is that BC uh group ID 1362 something?
Daniel Bagaporo: uh at the top here.
Mike Metoyer: No, it's line 23. 1362. That's interesting.
Daniel Bagaporo: 923. Oh, yeah.
Zach Ungerman: 1362. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: It's missing the one.
Daniel Bagaporo: Looks like that, huh? Let me see. Let me try pulling it up.
 
 
00:29:49
 
Mike Metoyer: And and if we need to do this as a whole group, that's totally cool. If if not, we can do this offline up the meeting just so we don't waste everybody's time.
Daniel Bagaporo: Right.
Mike Martin: And here's the thing. I I I think we probably do need to go offline, but again, my my whole goal of this, I don't want to take everyone's time. It's Friday. Everyone's got a lot of s*** to do. I just want to get some deadlines and some true expectations because what's happening for me is there's all of these projects that are all involved in this one thing that I've just explained to everybody. because they're all bottlenecked at this point. I feel like there's a lot of people going everything's on hold because Keenan wants two weeks and I need to make sure that that isn't the case. And if it is the case that we're doing everything we can in the background in lie of what he's doing and then if we're we've done all that then we're providing all the resources that are necessary to shut this two weeks down to three or four days.
 
 
00:30:45
 
Mike Martin: Okay. Have one more question. Matoyer, do you are you organizing based on HubSpot or any of your other data besides Dynamics um the hierarchy or all the different um delivery addresses for your chains that we can also cross reference
Mike Metoyer: Uh I personally don't have a spreadsheet but uh the best uh location to do that is the B2B app uh in Big Commerce uh because that's where we set parent child accounts and the junior senior buyers.
Mike Martin: Bill can help with that. Okay. Sounds good. Export. I'm wondering if we should do a overarching document that maps how we're uh data hygiene and the cadence of what we're doing. We're going to do this first. We're going to do this second. We're going to do this. Mike is doing it as far as the hierarchy goes. Um I we just and then the order of sequence. Yes. Because Yeah. We're going to have to review that. Yes. Right now I have I'm doing it by uh shipping address from Big Commerce, tying it to the account number and dynamics.
 
 
00:32:01
 
Mike Martin: Yeah. Then tying it back to the customer name and then region and kind of doing a reverse engineer to see if our information is right. What I think would help is that because there's a lot of information that's just in people's heads about customer hierarchies that we don't know that isn't mapped out in dynamics. If Mike, you or the sales team wanted to find out a way to create your own mockup of parent child relationships as far as we have that emerald intel. Perfect. That's 100% correct. Perfect. Then we use that to compare against mine and then we iterate those two and create a decision matrix on what is really the deciding factor. Is it the email shipping address or is it a mixture of both? Which one takes precedence over the other? Right. So what do we need to do to get that done? Uh well the Emerald Intel um did the parent child mapping so that's that's accurate. So and that's a that's a a pivot table spreadsheet.
 
 
00:33:01
 
Mike Martin: Have you seen that? Alex, is that what you shared with me uh last year? Something that Alex worked on.
Alex Mazzei: That that was the CSV. It's a CSV file, but it also has all the customers in the industry, not only their their uh and the the customers. So, it's like a master masterly of all of the parent child relationships based on their um mechanism that they use to identify which ones are parent and child.
Mike Martin: See, that's something we could use on the customer intake side where it's predictive in a sense where if we have a location that we didn't previously have, it would recommend the customer uh setup in dynamics.
Alex Mazzei: And the way I was looking at it was this is the closest
Mike Martin: So I'll take a look at that um distill it down to what our customers are and then do a onetoone match. All right.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, quick question for Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: So we work on that.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, do we have a HubSpot developer environment?
Mike Martin: Yes. I do not believe we do.
 
 
00:34:09
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Because from there, I can probably dig into HubSpot's API capabilities and kind of see what can be pulled from HubSpot and maybe we can find some connections that way.
Mike Martin: Um,
Alex Mazzei: I believe you have a sandbox with the account that you have that you're paying for with HubSpot.
Daniel Bagaporo: Well, maybe because I'm looking to get into its actual developer environment uh where it can like expose web hooks and API calls.
Alex Mazzei: Is that what you're asking?
Mike Martin: We don't have our phone.
Alex Mazzei: Stop. Look at the documentation.
Mike Martin: Yeah, but we don't have the credentials. There is docu There is API documentation for sure and Danny's probably looking at it, but we don't have a a dedicated environment for ourselves. I'm not aware of it anyways.
Daniel Bagaporo: Gotcha.
Mike Martin: All right. Um, so you're going to work on that. You got that Excel sheet. Yeah. Okay. So, you're going to work on that. You're going to meet with Stravo and you're going to get back.
 
 
00:35:08
 
Mike Martin: I need you to put something on the calendar for Monday or Tuesday. Right. So, we have action items there. Alex, can can you update me on this $80,000 or $80,000 this $80,000 part cleanup data cleanup that we were doing in in in HubSpot? I know we we had talked about it and and I don't know if we put any tools in place to kind of scrub it and consolidate. Um, but after talking to Mike here, it sounds like he's as good or if not better than I am in Excel, which means maybe we can have him work on some of that scrub if we haven't done it already. Um, can anyone, whether it's Alex or Matoyer, update me on where we're at with the HubSpot cleanup?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, I I haven't really seen seen too much.
Mike Martin: We haven't done anything.
Alex Mazzei: The only thing that I did was I took the Emerald Intel information and pinned it with the information that I got from the customer table from the dynamics and then once I was getting a confirmation from that I was going to move into if it made sense with the HubSpot and do the same approach but I have to break it down by state because the the information is too much to run with one one sweep.
 
 
00:36:26
 
Mike Martin: So these are the tentacles I'm talking about why it's why I wanted to have this.
Zach Ungerman: Oh, okay.
Mike Martin: So you're working on a project that he he can't move forward until you're done.
Zach Ungerman: So on on Phil by
Mike Martin: Okay. Right. So understanding that puts us in a place where I need you to help me prioritize his time where I get Alex what he needs so I can move this project forward. Okay. So he's going to work on that for you, Alex. He'll get that back to you. He'll put a timet on it after he looks at it. I'll have him send you an email on where we're at with that. Um you're going to set a meeting up. We'll meet again next week. I'm sorry I can't hear you.
Zach Ungerman: by scrub. Uh, do we are we talking about what Martin and the three of us have been talking about for a while? Data hygiene. Is that what we're talking about?
 
 
00:37:14
 
Zach Ungerman: Because we we kind of kind of we've been sitting here talking about data hygiene, but who's doing the data hygiene?
Mike Martin: Yes.
Zach Ungerman: Like, is that Mike?
Alex Mazzei: Hey,
Mike Martin: Literally what we just talked about.
Zach Ungerman: Okay.
Mike Martin: So Mike Mets has a template from Intel uh intelligence, whatever the hell that the third word party.
Zach Ungerman: Mike Mets. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Mike Martin: He's going to match that to his own records for the parent child. We're going to come up with the parent child relationships and through the parent child relationships, he's going to give that back to Alex. Alex is then going to use that as confirmed data and then scrub the rest of it and get rid of all the ones that shouldn't be there and give that back to us. At that point, someone has to then be in charge of uploading it back into HubSpot and getting the act the data loaded. So, who's going to do that? Jim. Sure. Okay. So, I'm on the same page and everyone else here understands. It's in Mike Mets's court right now. It's going to be passed to Alex. Alex then's going to get it to Kenan. Kenan's going to set a meeting on Monday to tell us what Strao said so we can shorten down our timeline and get back to our intel intelligence conversation and build that in. By next Wednesday, everybody should have a lot more clarity. Do I understand this right? Everybody out there, is that your understanding? Danny, Zack, Mike.
Zach Ungerman: Y yeah.
Mike Metoyer: Yep.
Mike Martin: All right, let's go after it, guys.
Mike Metoyer: The only thing I ask is The only thing I ask is before we do any imports uh to HubSpot uh just to verify with me or Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: Let's do it.
Mike Metoyer: But that's it.
Mike Martin: It's got to be done in sandbox and and we got to have a HubSpot sandbox. I don't want to f*** everything up worse than we already have.
Mike Metoyer: Go.
Mike Martin: All right. Anything else?
Daniel Bagaporo: No.

Hubspot and parent child clean up update  - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Mike Metoyer: What up, Alex? I'm good, brother. How you doing?
Alex Mazzei: What's going on?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, as far as uh far as what?
Alex Mazzei: I'm all right. You guys get anywhere like any updates on like things that are moving forward.
Mike Metoyer: Um, so I kind of I haven't really been touching too many IT projects to be honest with you, so I I can't necessarily answer that. I know um HubSpot, I don't know if Zach was involved, but uh Kenan um and IT team I'm assuming um decided to put a little pause on the uh HubSpot project just due to uh cleaning up some uh company records and contacts because he was telling me in Dynamics he might have to create new or different forms to actually plug into Sky Villa um if we even go that route. He was like I was looking at a couple other options too. So, I'm not sure on uh on that piece, but yeah, we can hear a little more from him, but uh I did have something that I I did want to show you and and I could wait uh just to show you before we Yeah.
 
 
00:04:33
 
Mike Metoyer: So, everybody's in the call and they can see what I'm talking about. But, uh as we're cleaning up uh HubSpot just to match dynamics, just some of that data. Uh I actually looked into some of the fields. Um and there's actually a field called Big Commerce customer ID. Um, and so I guess before we we do make this transition to make web better, I was going to see if we could use that uh that middleware software or whatever to actually plug in the Big Commerce ID
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Mike Metoyer: number from the customer um into into HubSpot. I I don't know um if it's an option. Uh I just yeah was playing around with it and wanted to see.
Alex Mazzei: How you doing, Z?
Zach Ungerman: I'm doing well.
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Zach Ungerman: So, just Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, there's a few more people on the meeting, right?
Mike Metoyer: You uh you
Alex Mazzei: So, I I didn't want to go into too much details until we had everybody that were supposed to be on this main.
 
 
00:05:32
 
Alex Mazzei: It was like seven or eight people.
Mike Metoyer: There's a lot of people for sure.
Zach Ungerman: So, most of them are in the office. So, just wait for them to log on before we continue.
Mike Metoyer: Alex, you back home. Where you at? Damn. Okay. Jeez. Hopefully you're getting some good food out there, too.
Mike Martin: It's just Alex is join us. Looks like everybody. How are we doing?
Mike Metoyer: What's up? Good. How you guys doing?
Mike Martin: Good, good, good. How are you?
Zach Ungerman: Good.
Mike Metoyer: Good.
Mike Martin: Look at all those handsome faces, man. Good looking group.
Alex Mazzei: What's up, guys? I'm I'm in transition and there's like spotty uh cellular some.
Mike Martin: All right. Where what city are you in now, Alex?
Alex Mazzei: I don't know. It's Claremont for Mont. I don't know where the hell I am. New Hampshire.
Mike Martin: New Hampshire. All right. All right, guys.
 
 
00:08:28
 
Mike Martin: Well, I don't want to take everyone's time. This is a quick just update for everybody just to make sure we're all on the same page. We've got uh a bunch of things that are all pending each other is the way I'm going to describe it. So, we've got our HubSpot thing that we're dealing with. We have our middleware that we're dealing with. We have um the data cleanup process with the 80,000 uh entries that we've got to clean up. So, with with all of these things that we currently have in the air that are kind of all pending on this particular project, there has been a request from Kenan to to hold off for a little bit. so he can, you know, get some data cleaned up in the system. One of the things because Kenan is new, I want to make sure that everybody here understands holdups and pauses at this point in our project, I want defined and I want him to have all the resources he needs to limit that time. So when I hear two weeks of data, it scares the s*** out of me.
 
 
00:09:29
 
Mike Martin: I want to know what we're doing because you know an analogy that Matoyer gave me I think kind of rings true. We have plumbing and then we've got the water flow that goes in the plumbing and we do need to get this third party company building this out and part of that needs to I think happen at the same time that we're cleaning the data. And so because I'm hearing bits of information from Kenan, a little bit of information from Alex, little bit of information from Mike, I really want to close this gap here today and understand where we are. What are our true deadlines? Are we still on track to hit what we're we've all been talking about, which is 91, and have some true measurement here. Um, and with that, I'll open up the floor to anybody who wants to jump in and either correct me, set me straight, or or tell me everything I just said is accurate and give me some dates.
Alex Mazzei: Is is and Mike Mets with you?
Mike Martin: Mike Mets was invited to this meeting.
 
 
00:10:31
 
Mike Martin: I know he's on the meeting. He's not here, though. He was there. Uh, let me go grab him. I'll go walk over and grab him. I'll be right back. just uh kind of where I'm sitting at.
Alex Mazzei: Thank you.
Mike Martin: We have a meeting with Strawos today on how to better organize the parent child relationship in the system. Currently, we have all the data. It's in the system. However, when sales orders get created in Big Commerce with delivery addresses, those delivery addresses don't live on the customer record themselves. They just live on the sales orders. So, we need that data on um like new sales orders, new delivery addresses to be also applied to the customer record itself. So we have all the data sitting in one place. That's something Diana's and Mike are dealing with too. They're pulling we're pulling the customer data from Dynamics but all the addresses are not there. So we're to manipulate the delivery addresses to kind of uh link them to the correct parent account.
 
 
00:11:19
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah,
Mike Martin: The what's considered the parent account is the invoice account. Uh so that's the top level of it. So assuming that we think there's lower levels to that then we then we can reorganize the the delivery addresses to create chains. Um because right now the current way that we organize it through dynamics it's it's actually like a marketing module but it's it's a manual thing that we have to manually create the chain and all that. It's not efficient. The field is there but it's in the marketing section of the customer record. Got it. But I mean it's it it can live there. That's fine. And we just have to to ident correctly identify each of the company chains to make sure all the MSOs have all of their children underneath that chain. So we have the parent address which is the billing address and then we have the child addresses which are going to be delivery addresses shipping addresses.
Alex Mazzei: Was the the information from Emerald Intel able to help you at all, Kenan?
 
 
00:12:34
 
Mike Martin: We did not even cross check it with that. I mean that that data is important but it's it's all national, you know, that that's kind of encompassing everybody like people that we don't even serve. Um I mean it could be helpful for sales for sure. Um but we haven't cross- checked it. That that is something we can do whenever we we do our final audit. Um, that could be helpful in doing the USPS address format as well. Yep.
Mike Metoyer: So
Alex Mazzei: So basically what I'm hearing is you have the data that you're able to collect and you have two different One addresses. is the the shipping and one is the billing address. And you're using that information as the parent child relationship to set this up as a initial master sheet or master list.
Mike Martin: Right. In dynamics. Yep.
Alex Mazzei: And how confident are you everything that you need like and you're moving in the direction you need? Like what what support or help do you need from us?
 
 
00:13:30
 
Mike Martin: pretty confident because every pretty confident because every every address that comes from Big Commerce is a shipping address.
Alex Mazzei: Okay.
Mike Martin: They don't even denote billing address on their right. um that we did find billing addresses and the only reason I say this is because we found like a good bunch of PO addresses and we don't ship to PO so I'm assuming but those those addresses they might
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, you do have the billing
Mike Martin: but do those those billing addresses don't come over in the integration right so anything that is in Dynamics I can't understand is a shipping address in theory unless they mistakenly put their invoice address as a shipping address, which could happen, I guess. All right, guys. We're back.
Mike Metoyer: Well, and and Kenan, even with that, I would say the customers that do have a billing address, I would say less than 5% of our records, if that, actually use that billing address. Um, most people just use the shipping.
Mike Martin: We're invoicing. Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Uh yeah, for for uh like yeah, like our customers for invoicing.
 
 
00:14:36
 
Mike Martin: Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Yes. Um for sure. Uh specifically because we're not we're not in the 90s anymore where we're not hand mailing these invoices out. Um it's it's typically via email and so they want to actually see what shipping address that the invoice is tied to. Um,
Mike Martin: Gota way to the shipping address because that's what the invoice comes with. But that's what our customer prefers.
Mike Metoyer: So I guess I guess just touching on on So I I is.
Mike Martin: You can pay me and I can throw it in the trash if you want. I'm happy to do that. It'd be faster. But uh I wanted to uh point out that Mike is organizing our data that we pulled um through Big Commerce to kind of um simulate what we want to see in dynamics um pinpointing which ones would be the chains and which ones are their child accounts which are the delivery um addresses. And then the third part of that is creating like a region which as you know Mike like for example Curleaf likes their building per states um that's what we would consider a region but there's other MSOs's that handle their AP across different states but that's the the next step of that.
 
 
00:16:12
 
Mike Martin: So again, just just to recap, so I want to make sure because bringing Mike in, which I didn't have him in involved initially, but understanding he's working on parent child relationships, which kind of all ties into the HubSpot thing, which all ties into the middleware. So, I just want to get on the same page real quick with everybody and again close some dates off and make sure that we're not duplicating each other's work. And especially if he's put in enough time on this, we can run with what he has. Uh or vice versa, if someone else is already putting in time on this, we we just get together and collaborate. So, Alex, I know you had a question for Mike. That's why I went to go grab him. You want to jump back on?
Alex Mazzei: No, I just know that between what he was showing me in his office and some of the Google meets that we had of the data in his Excel spreadsheets, he had a lot of information organized. And I know Kenan and him were working together on that.
 
 
00:17:09
 
Alex Mazzei: And I just wanted him to be in this meeting because I feel like he has the ability that he's understanding what needs to happen, but he's also looking at the information. So when he's looking at it, he knows if it's right or wrong. and and I know Keenan has the back end of the ERP stuff as his skill set. So having both of those people in this meeting was paramount for me.
Mike Martin: So I mean everybody on the line here, everybody understands the parent child relationship. Everybody understands the middleware. Everybody understands what we're trying to get accomplished with dynamics, HubSpot, and Big Commerce. Is there anyone that's on the line that does not understand what we're trying to get accomplished? Then as we move forward, it's going to make sense because I need to know where we're at with timelines. When when's my next deadline? When what what's when's my next action item, deliverable? Where are we at? Meeting today with Straw Bus to review the best way to organize this data in Dynamics.
 
 
00:18:12
 
Mike Martin: Um once we have that methodology, then we can import the clean data that Mike has. Um we'll have to work on a import template for that. Um but once that's established, we should have correct hierarchy. We're also going to have to talk to strus about how we classify those uh regional operators and remove the tree. So I guess by the end of day we can probably have a good idea of how long the system will take based on what they tell us. I'd say so. Yeah. So then once they tell us that what's the next step? Organizing the data. um getting the data set up and in an import template that Kenan can use to upload to dynamics and then subsequent mail file and again I'm the idiot in the room speaking we're doing all this in sandbox. Yes. Right. Everybody understands we're doing all this in sandbox. Okay. So then when's an expectation that this will be done in sandbox, approved in sandbox that we can I can look forward to then moving forward with the other projects or can these other projects be moving simultaneously with this project?
 
 
00:19:18
 
Mike Martin: Right. Where we at with the middleware company? We I sent an email a couple days ago told and told them to hold off for at least a couple weeks. Okay. Why a couple weeks? Why not five days? Why not two days? Why not three days? Because I don't know what the timeline Strauss is going to give us. on or even if they have I don't even know if if they have the current um hierarchy relationship even in dynamics. I don't know they do. So okay. Yeah, it's there. So it could be five days. It could be two weeks. Okay. What what I'm going to say is we probably this meeting is probably premature understanding what I just found out. Probably need to have this meeting after you we have this meeting with Strao. So we're going to put this back on the calendar probably for Monday. That's okay with everybody else. Any other questions I need to understand what Mike?
 
 
00:20:06
 
Mike Martin: Go ahead.
Mike Metoyer: Yeah. So, uh I know you guys are you have a huge focus on uh Dynamics, which obviously that's going to be our source of truth. Uh when we're actually porting it over to HubSpot, um you know, originally uh they uh Instrumental Group was going to use the domain name as far as like uh connecting the accounts um and emails. Um I don't know if that's going to be the best way. So, I I was playing around in HubSpot and there is actually a field where you can input a Bitcommerce customer ID number. Um, and so with that, I don't know if we could uh create a workflow or have Make Web Better import that information from Big Commerce uh before we shut it off just so it's an easy match. Um, but yeah, I just wanted to ask you guys on that. It looks like Danny um is in charge of the workflows on that side.
Mike Martin: So once once an order is created in Big Commerce, it gets pushed to both Dynamics and HubSpot.
 
 
00:21:01
 
Mike Martin: That has to have a unique identifier that that's the same across both platforms, right? So that's the field that you're trying to put into HubSpot. Mike, that unique identifier, how's it being read right now, Mike?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, it's essentially uh Yeah.
Mike Martin: email.
Mike Metoyer: Uh I I don't know. Uh that's a question for Mike Martin. I think he has it uh based on email, the contacts.
Mike Martin: Yeah. Yeah. So uh the the flow goes uh email which goes uh which is a contact and um HubSpot automatically generates uh the primary company associated with the contact as long as it's uh a URL that's readable. So, if it's Mike M at Gmail, then it wouldn't create a uh company associated with Mike Martin because it's a Gmail account. So, there are some scenarios like that in HubSpot, but for the most part, that's how it's set up currently where it's automated by URL uh on the email. How how confident do you guys feel about the organization of the companies in in HubSpot where we can reference that as far as like okay so this company belongs to this chain HubSpot I feel we haven't done a
 
 
00:22:21
 
Mike Metoyer: I don't think we should go that route, but what do you what do you think, Martin?
Mike Martin: lot of hygiene anything that's been done has been automated that's probably going to be accurate but when it's um there are some situations where there's secondary tertiary level like Schwaz is a good example where it's not smart enough to read that and then we've been some people have been doing it by hand where they they have uh uh star buds and then they show primary is schwaz secondary is emeralds fields and they've been kind of just uh dragging and dropping that. So the question we have to ask ourselves is so everything in in Dynamics is driven by company uh billing um and everything pretty much in HubSpot's driven by contact and shipping. So that's where we're going to have to think through how do we combine how how do we merge the data? The origin is always big commerce. So we there should be a unique identifier. Yeah. It's an email right now and that's where problem lies.
 
 
00:23:40
 
Mike Martin: It should be a unique identifier that is a customer ID. It should not be an email or a contact or anything that's going to constantly evolve or change. That's a mistake. It should be ran by some form of customer number. Um and even with that there should be a hierarchy within the customer numbers. You can make your customer numbers however you want. So if I decided that one, two was curleaf, then I've got a hund, you know, 200 stores or whatever after that that I know everything one, two is curleaf, one, two, one is cure leaf one. One, two, two is cure leaf two, one, two, three is curle leaf four. Um, and you can push that all the way out through all of your MSOs through your unique identifiers. Or you can just do them chronologically. Just throw them in, you know, customer one through 10,00. But in either case, in my opinion, that's the way it should be.
Mike Metoyer: So, so how we have it right now is that unique identifier is in the uh the URL up top.
 
 
00:24:38
 
Mike Metoyer: So, for instance, I'm on Guushi's account. uh their bastard account is 13621. So ultimately before we we do this integration with uh dynamics to HubSpot there is a field in HubSpot on this bottom I just added it big commerce customer ID number. So there has to be a workflow where we can get that number and plug it into here. So when we're doing our our our lookup or whatever for Dynamics and our HubSpot customers, it's an automatic match and and we don't have to worry about it. So ideally I would Yeah.
Mike Martin: Who who has this connector right now? Who has the most information on this connector? And whoever's running this connector right now for us is the person that can I mean that's just another addition. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: So based on this make web better, it looks like Danny um was the one that was kind of touching it um last, but this was a couple years ago. This was last year in 2024. So, um I'm not 100% sure.
Mike Martin: Danny, Zach, any input is is adding That field going to be a problem.
 
 
00:25:43
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah, we just uh Go ahead, Danny. But yeah, that's that's what the connection between HubSpot and BigCom is. That's what we use it. We got we have to look into it. So today we can
Daniel Bagaporo: So the thing about that is make web better has its own specific set of parameters that it looks for. I'm looking at its configurations and it looks like that maybe I can I can look around and see what is in there but customer ID sync doesn't seem to be part of its uh automations. For example, um, uh, Matoyer, the, uh, the that Juicy customer ID, what was it again?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, it is going to be 13621.
Daniel Bagaporo: Okay, let me see. So, I'm going to share my screen in just a second here and kind of just uh show you how customer information gets ported over. And I'm going to use Juicy as an example. One second. So what you see right now is kind of like where everything that we see off of make web better.
 
 
00:27:10
 
Daniel Bagaporo: This is how customers are getting synced. It looks like that there are some missing fields here. And I went to go and look at this one in particular. Uh for whatever reason, this is pretty much what shows up in that in that contacts information, right? So, it's not sure where it's reading all of this information, but it's definitely just based off of it's it looks like it's based off of just like the email address. That's where the contact gets sync because email address is common between the customer uh information, the order information and so on, right? to sync off of the uh company ID or the customer group ID. There are two ways about that. The 13621 is the is essentially kind of like what I keep labeling as the BTOC portion of it, but there's also this company ID down here pulled through API which is the B2B uh company ID. So in terms of what to sync from where there are multiple avenues that we can kind of pull that kind of information.
 
 
00:28:19
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Oh wait I let me present sorry. Right. So this is uh so this is the the contact uh the company ID from B TOC 13621 entered up here and the return information is being pulled from the B2B record or API record. So there there are the the one thing that we need to get straight is where are we going to start pulling this information from? Because uh as I explained to Kenan, the original connector was built with B2C in mind, but then we eventually moved on to upgrading to kind of like a B2B environment in Big Commerce. And yeah.
Mike Martin: Yep. We never redesigned it when we start.
Mike Metoyer: What what's what's that line ID uh on number 23? Is that BC uh group ID 1362 something?
Daniel Bagaporo: uh at the top here.
Mike Metoyer: No, it's line 23. 1362. That's interesting.
Daniel Bagaporo: 923. Oh, yeah.
Zach Ungerman: 1362. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: It's missing the one.
Daniel Bagaporo: Looks like that, huh? Let me see. Let me try pulling it up.
 
 
00:29:49
 
Mike Metoyer: And and if we need to do this as a whole group, that's totally cool. If if not, we can do this offline up the meeting just so we don't waste everybody's time.
Daniel Bagaporo: Right.
Mike Martin: And here's the thing. I I I think we probably do need to go offline, but again, my my whole goal of this, I don't want to take everyone's time. It's Friday. Everyone's got a lot of s*** to do. I just want to get some deadlines and some true expectations because what's happening for me is there's all of these projects that are all involved in this one thing that I've just explained to everybody. because they're all bottlenecked at this point. I feel like there's a lot of people going everything's on hold because Keenan wants two weeks and I need to make sure that that isn't the case. And if it is the case that we're doing everything we can in the background in lie of what he's doing and then if we're we've done all that then we're providing all the resources that are necessary to shut this two weeks down to three or four days.
 
 
00:30:45
 
Mike Martin: Okay. Have one more question. Matoyer, do you are you organizing based on HubSpot or any of your other data besides Dynamics um the hierarchy or all the different um delivery addresses for your chains that we can also cross reference
Mike Metoyer: Uh I personally don't have a spreadsheet but uh the best uh location to do that is the B2B app uh in Big Commerce uh because that's where we set parent child accounts and the junior senior buyers.
Mike Martin: Bill can help with that. Okay. Sounds good. Export. I'm wondering if we should do a overarching document that maps how we're uh data hygiene and the cadence of what we're doing. We're going to do this first. We're going to do this second. We're going to do this. Mike is doing it as far as the hierarchy goes. Um I we just and then the order of sequence. Yes. Because Yeah. We're going to have to review that. Yes. Right now I have I'm doing it by uh shipping address from Big Commerce, tying it to the account number and dynamics.
 
 
00:32:01
 
Mike Martin: Yeah. Then tying it back to the customer name and then region and kind of doing a reverse engineer to see if our information is right. What I think would help is that because there's a lot of information that's just in people's heads about customer hierarchies that we don't know that isn't mapped out in dynamics. If Mike, you or the sales team wanted to find out a way to create your own mockup of parent child relationships as far as we have that emerald intel. Perfect. That's 100% correct. Perfect. Then we use that to compare against mine and then we iterate those two and create a decision matrix on what is really the deciding factor. Is it the email shipping address or is it a mixture of both? Which one takes precedence over the other? Right. So what do we need to do to get that done? Uh well the Emerald Intel um did the parent child mapping so that's that's accurate. So and that's a that's a a pivot table spreadsheet.
 
 
00:33:01
 
Mike Martin: Have you seen that? Alex, is that what you shared with me uh last year? Something that Alex worked on.
Alex Mazzei: That that was the CSV. It's a CSV file, but it also has all the customers in the industry, not only their their uh and the the customers. So, it's like a master masterly of all of the parent child relationships based on their um mechanism that they use to identify which ones are parent and child.
Mike Martin: See, that's something we could use on the customer intake side where it's predictive in a sense where if we have a location that we didn't previously have, it would recommend the customer uh setup in dynamics.
Alex Mazzei: And the way I was looking at it was this is the closest
Mike Martin: So I'll take a look at that um distill it down to what our customers are and then do a onetoone match. All right.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, quick question for Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: So we work on that.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, do we have a HubSpot developer environment?
Mike Martin: Yes. I do not believe we do.
 
 
00:34:09
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Because from there, I can probably dig into HubSpot's API capabilities and kind of see what can be pulled from HubSpot and maybe we can find some connections that way.
Mike Martin: Um,
Alex Mazzei: I believe you have a sandbox with the account that you have that you're paying for with HubSpot.
Daniel Bagaporo: Well, maybe because I'm looking to get into its actual developer environment uh where it can like expose web hooks and API calls.
Alex Mazzei: Is that what you're asking?
Mike Martin: We don't have our phone.
Alex Mazzei: Stop. Look at the documentation.
Mike Martin: Yeah, but we don't have the credentials. There is docu There is API documentation for sure and Danny's probably looking at it, but we don't have a a dedicated environment for ourselves. I'm not aware of it anyways.
Daniel Bagaporo: Gotcha.
Mike Martin: All right. Um, so you're going to work on that. You got that Excel sheet. Yeah. Okay. So, you're going to work on that. You're going to meet with Stravo and you're going to get back.
 
 
00:35:08
 
Mike Martin: I need you to put something on the calendar for Monday or Tuesday. Right. So, we have action items there. Alex, can can you update me on this $80,000 or $80,000 this $80,000 part cleanup data cleanup that we were doing in in in HubSpot? I know we we had talked about it and and I don't know if we put any tools in place to kind of scrub it and consolidate. Um, but after talking to Mike here, it sounds like he's as good or if not better than I am in Excel, which means maybe we can have him work on some of that scrub if we haven't done it already. Um, can anyone, whether it's Alex or Matoyer, update me on where we're at with the HubSpot cleanup?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, I I haven't really seen seen too much.
Mike Martin: We haven't done anything.
Alex Mazzei: The only thing that I did was I took the Emerald Intel information and pinned it with the information that I got from the customer table from the dynamics and then once I was getting a confirmation from that I was going to move into if it made sense with the HubSpot and do the same approach but I have to break it down by state because the the information is too much to run with one one sweep.
 
 
00:36:26
 
Mike Martin: So these are the tentacles I'm talking about why it's why I wanted to have this.
Zach Ungerman: Oh, okay.
Mike Martin: So you're working on a project that he he can't move forward until you're done.
Zach Ungerman: So on on Phil by
Mike Martin: Okay. Right. So understanding that puts us in a place where I need you to help me prioritize his time where I get Alex what he needs so I can move this project forward. Okay. So he's going to work on that for you, Alex. He'll get that back to you. He'll put a timet on it after he looks at it. I'll have him send you an email on where we're at with that. Um you're going to set a meeting up. We'll meet again next week. I'm sorry I can't hear you.
Zach Ungerman: by scrub. Uh, do we are we talking about what Martin and the three of us have been talking about for a while? Data hygiene. Is that what we're talking about?
 
 
00:37:14
 
Zach Ungerman: Because we we kind of kind of we've been sitting here talking about data hygiene, but who's doing the data hygiene?
Mike Martin: Yes.
Zach Ungerman: Like, is that Mike?
Alex Mazzei: Hey,
Mike Martin: Literally what we just talked about.
Zach Ungerman: Okay.
Mike Martin: So Mike Mets has a template from Intel uh intelligence, whatever the hell that the third word party.
Zach Ungerman: Mike Mets. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Mike Martin: He's going to match that to his own records for the parent child. We're going to come up with the parent child relationships and through the parent child relationships, he's going to give that back to Alex. Alex is then going to use that as confirmed data and then scrub the rest of it and get rid of all the ones that shouldn't be there and give that back to us. At that point, someone has to then be in charge of uploading it back into HubSpot and getting the act the data loaded. So, who's going to do that? Jim. Sure. Okay. So, I'm on the same page and everyone else here understands. It's in Mike Mets's court right now. It's going to be passed to Alex. Alex then's going to get it to Kenan. Kenan's going to set a meeting on Monday to tell us what Strao said so we can shorten down our timeline and get back to our intel intelligence conversation and build that in. By next Wednesday, everybody should have a lot more clarity. Do I understand this right? Everybody out there, is that your understanding? Danny, Zack, Mike.
Zach Ungerman: Y yeah.
Mike Metoyer: Yep.
Mike Martin: All right, let's go after it, guys.
Mike Metoyer: The only thing I ask is The only thing I ask is before we do any imports uh to HubSpot uh just to verify with me or Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: Let's do it.
Mike Metoyer: But that's it.
Mike Martin: It's got to be done in sandbox and and we got to have a HubSpot sandbox. I don't want to f*** everything up worse than we already have.
Mike Metoyer: Go.
Mike Martin: All right. Anything else?
Daniel Bagaporo: No.

Hubspot and parent child clean up update  - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Mike Metoyer: What up, Alex? I'm good, brother. How you doing?
Alex Mazzei: What's going on?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, as far as uh far as what?
Alex Mazzei: I'm all right. You guys get anywhere like any updates on like things that are moving forward.
Mike Metoyer: Um, so I kind of I haven't really been touching too many IT projects to be honest with you, so I I can't necessarily answer that. I know um HubSpot, I don't know if Zach was involved, but uh Kenan um and IT team I'm assuming um decided to put a little pause on the uh HubSpot project just due to uh cleaning up some uh company records and contacts because he was telling me in Dynamics he might have to create new or different forms to actually plug into Sky Villa um if we even go that route. He was like I was looking at a couple other options too. So, I'm not sure on uh on that piece, but yeah, we can hear a little more from him, but uh I did have something that I I did want to show you and and I could wait uh just to show you before we Yeah.
 
 
00:04:33
 
Mike Metoyer: So, everybody's in the call and they can see what I'm talking about. But, uh as we're cleaning up uh HubSpot just to match dynamics, just some of that data. Uh I actually looked into some of the fields. Um and there's actually a field called Big Commerce customer ID. Um, and so I guess before we we do make this transition to make web better, I was going to see if we could use that uh that middleware software or whatever to actually plug in the Big Commerce ID
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Mike Metoyer: number from the customer um into into HubSpot. I I don't know um if it's an option. Uh I just yeah was playing around with it and wanted to see.
Alex Mazzei: How you doing, Z?
Zach Ungerman: I'm doing well.
Alex Mazzei: Awesome.
Zach Ungerman: So, just Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, there's a few more people on the meeting, right?
Mike Metoyer: You uh you
Alex Mazzei: So, I I didn't want to go into too much details until we had everybody that were supposed to be on this main.
 
 
00:05:32
 
Alex Mazzei: It was like seven or eight people.
Mike Metoyer: There's a lot of people for sure.
Zach Ungerman: So, most of them are in the office. So, just wait for them to log on before we continue.
Mike Metoyer: Alex, you back home. Where you at? Damn. Okay. Jeez. Hopefully you're getting some good food out there, too.
Mike Martin: It's just Alex is join us. Looks like everybody. How are we doing?
Mike Metoyer: What's up? Good. How you guys doing?
Mike Martin: Good, good, good. How are you?
Zach Ungerman: Good.
Mike Metoyer: Good.
Mike Martin: Look at all those handsome faces, man. Good looking group.
Alex Mazzei: What's up, guys? I'm I'm in transition and there's like spotty uh cellular some.
Mike Martin: All right. Where what city are you in now, Alex?
Alex Mazzei: I don't know. It's Claremont for Mont. I don't know where the hell I am. New Hampshire.
Mike Martin: New Hampshire. All right. All right, guys.
 
 
00:08:28
 
Mike Martin: Well, I don't want to take everyone's time. This is a quick just update for everybody just to make sure we're all on the same page. We've got uh a bunch of things that are all pending each other is the way I'm going to describe it. So, we've got our HubSpot thing that we're dealing with. We have our middleware that we're dealing with. We have um the data cleanup process with the 80,000 uh entries that we've got to clean up. So, with with all of these things that we currently have in the air that are kind of all pending on this particular project, there has been a request from Kenan to to hold off for a little bit. so he can, you know, get some data cleaned up in the system. One of the things because Kenan is new, I want to make sure that everybody here understands holdups and pauses at this point in our project, I want defined and I want him to have all the resources he needs to limit that time. So when I hear two weeks of data, it scares the s*** out of me.
 
 
00:09:29
 
Mike Martin: I want to know what we're doing because you know an analogy that Matoyer gave me I think kind of rings true. We have plumbing and then we've got the water flow that goes in the plumbing and we do need to get this third party company building this out and part of that needs to I think happen at the same time that we're cleaning the data. And so because I'm hearing bits of information from Kenan, a little bit of information from Alex, little bit of information from Mike, I really want to close this gap here today and understand where we are. What are our true deadlines? Are we still on track to hit what we're we've all been talking about, which is 91, and have some true measurement here. Um, and with that, I'll open up the floor to anybody who wants to jump in and either correct me, set me straight, or or tell me everything I just said is accurate and give me some dates.
Alex Mazzei: Is is and Mike Mets with you?
Mike Martin: Mike Mets was invited to this meeting.
 
 
00:10:31
 
Mike Martin: I know he's on the meeting. He's not here, though. He was there. Uh, let me go grab him. I'll go walk over and grab him. I'll be right back. just uh kind of where I'm sitting at.
Alex Mazzei: Thank you.
Mike Martin: We have a meeting with Strawos today on how to better organize the parent child relationship in the system. Currently, we have all the data. It's in the system. However, when sales orders get created in Big Commerce with delivery addresses, those delivery addresses don't live on the customer record themselves. They just live on the sales orders. So, we need that data on um like new sales orders, new delivery addresses to be also applied to the customer record itself. So we have all the data sitting in one place. That's something Diana's and Mike are dealing with too. They're pulling we're pulling the customer data from Dynamics but all the addresses are not there. So we're to manipulate the delivery addresses to kind of uh link them to the correct parent account.
 
 
00:11:19
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah,
Mike Martin: The what's considered the parent account is the invoice account. Uh so that's the top level of it. So assuming that we think there's lower levels to that then we then we can reorganize the the delivery addresses to create chains. Um because right now the current way that we organize it through dynamics it's it's actually like a marketing module but it's it's a manual thing that we have to manually create the chain and all that. It's not efficient. The field is there but it's in the marketing section of the customer record. Got it. But I mean it's it it can live there. That's fine. And we just have to to ident correctly identify each of the company chains to make sure all the MSOs have all of their children underneath that chain. So we have the parent address which is the billing address and then we have the child addresses which are going to be delivery addresses shipping addresses.
Alex Mazzei: Was the the information from Emerald Intel able to help you at all, Kenan?
 
 
00:12:34
 
Mike Martin: We did not even cross check it with that. I mean that that data is important but it's it's all national, you know, that that's kind of encompassing everybody like people that we don't even serve. Um I mean it could be helpful for sales for sure. Um but we haven't cross- checked it. That that is something we can do whenever we we do our final audit. Um, that could be helpful in doing the USPS address format as well. Yep.
Mike Metoyer: So
Alex Mazzei: So basically what I'm hearing is you have the data that you're able to collect and you have two different One addresses. is the the shipping and one is the billing address. And you're using that information as the parent child relationship to set this up as a initial master sheet or master list.
Mike Martin: Right. In dynamics. Yep.
Alex Mazzei: And how confident are you everything that you need like and you're moving in the direction you need? Like what what support or help do you need from us?
 
 
00:13:30
 
Mike Martin: pretty confident because every pretty confident because every every address that comes from Big Commerce is a shipping address.
Alex Mazzei: Okay.
Mike Martin: They don't even denote billing address on their right. um that we did find billing addresses and the only reason I say this is because we found like a good bunch of PO addresses and we don't ship to PO so I'm assuming but those those addresses they might
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, you do have the billing
Mike Martin: but do those those billing addresses don't come over in the integration right so anything that is in Dynamics I can't understand is a shipping address in theory unless they mistakenly put their invoice address as a shipping address, which could happen, I guess. All right, guys. We're back.
Mike Metoyer: Well, and and Kenan, even with that, I would say the customers that do have a billing address, I would say less than 5% of our records, if that, actually use that billing address. Um, most people just use the shipping.
Mike Martin: We're invoicing. Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Uh yeah, for for uh like yeah, like our customers for invoicing.
 
 
00:14:36
 
Mike Martin: Yes.
Mike Metoyer: Yes. Um for sure. Uh specifically because we're not we're not in the 90s anymore where we're not hand mailing these invoices out. Um it's it's typically via email and so they want to actually see what shipping address that the invoice is tied to. Um,
Mike Martin: Gota way to the shipping address because that's what the invoice comes with. But that's what our customer prefers.
Mike Metoyer: So I guess I guess just touching on on So I I is.
Mike Martin: You can pay me and I can throw it in the trash if you want. I'm happy to do that. It'd be faster. But uh I wanted to uh point out that Mike is organizing our data that we pulled um through Big Commerce to kind of um simulate what we want to see in dynamics um pinpointing which ones would be the chains and which ones are their child accounts which are the delivery um addresses. And then the third part of that is creating like a region which as you know Mike like for example Curleaf likes their building per states um that's what we would consider a region but there's other MSOs's that handle their AP across different states but that's the the next step of that.
 
 
00:16:12
 
Mike Martin: So again, just just to recap, so I want to make sure because bringing Mike in, which I didn't have him in involved initially, but understanding he's working on parent child relationships, which kind of all ties into the HubSpot thing, which all ties into the middleware. So, I just want to get on the same page real quick with everybody and again close some dates off and make sure that we're not duplicating each other's work. And especially if he's put in enough time on this, we can run with what he has. Uh or vice versa, if someone else is already putting in time on this, we we just get together and collaborate. So, Alex, I know you had a question for Mike. That's why I went to go grab him. You want to jump back on?
Alex Mazzei: No, I just know that between what he was showing me in his office and some of the Google meets that we had of the data in his Excel spreadsheets, he had a lot of information organized. And I know Kenan and him were working together on that.
 
 
00:17:09
 
Alex Mazzei: And I just wanted him to be in this meeting because I feel like he has the ability that he's understanding what needs to happen, but he's also looking at the information. So when he's looking at it, he knows if it's right or wrong. and and I know Keenan has the back end of the ERP stuff as his skill set. So having both of those people in this meeting was paramount for me.
Mike Martin: So I mean everybody on the line here, everybody understands the parent child relationship. Everybody understands the middleware. Everybody understands what we're trying to get accomplished with dynamics, HubSpot, and Big Commerce. Is there anyone that's on the line that does not understand what we're trying to get accomplished? Then as we move forward, it's going to make sense because I need to know where we're at with timelines. When when's my next deadline? When what what's when's my next action item, deliverable? Where are we at? Meeting today with Straw Bus to review the best way to organize this data in Dynamics.
 
 
00:18:12
 
Mike Martin: Um once we have that methodology, then we can import the clean data that Mike has. Um we'll have to work on a import template for that. Um but once that's established, we should have correct hierarchy. We're also going to have to talk to strus about how we classify those uh regional operators and remove the tree. So I guess by the end of day we can probably have a good idea of how long the system will take based on what they tell us. I'd say so. Yeah. So then once they tell us that what's the next step? Organizing the data. um getting the data set up and in an import template that Kenan can use to upload to dynamics and then subsequent mail file and again I'm the idiot in the room speaking we're doing all this in sandbox. Yes. Right. Everybody understands we're doing all this in sandbox. Okay. So then when's an expectation that this will be done in sandbox, approved in sandbox that we can I can look forward to then moving forward with the other projects or can these other projects be moving simultaneously with this project?
 
 
00:19:18
 
Mike Martin: Right. Where we at with the middleware company? We I sent an email a couple days ago told and told them to hold off for at least a couple weeks. Okay. Why a couple weeks? Why not five days? Why not two days? Why not three days? Because I don't know what the timeline Strauss is going to give us. on or even if they have I don't even know if if they have the current um hierarchy relationship even in dynamics. I don't know they do. So okay. Yeah, it's there. So it could be five days. It could be two weeks. Okay. What what I'm going to say is we probably this meeting is probably premature understanding what I just found out. Probably need to have this meeting after you we have this meeting with Strao. So we're going to put this back on the calendar probably for Monday. That's okay with everybody else. Any other questions I need to understand what Mike?
 
 
00:20:06
 
Mike Martin: Go ahead.
Mike Metoyer: Yeah. So, uh I know you guys are you have a huge focus on uh Dynamics, which obviously that's going to be our source of truth. Uh when we're actually porting it over to HubSpot, um you know, originally uh they uh Instrumental Group was going to use the domain name as far as like uh connecting the accounts um and emails. Um I don't know if that's going to be the best way. So, I I was playing around in HubSpot and there is actually a field where you can input a Bitcommerce customer ID number. Um, and so with that, I don't know if we could uh create a workflow or have Make Web Better import that information from Big Commerce uh before we shut it off just so it's an easy match. Um, but yeah, I just wanted to ask you guys on that. It looks like Danny um is in charge of the workflows on that side.
Mike Martin: So once once an order is created in Big Commerce, it gets pushed to both Dynamics and HubSpot.
 
 
00:21:01
 
Mike Martin: That has to have a unique identifier that that's the same across both platforms, right? So that's the field that you're trying to put into HubSpot. Mike, that unique identifier, how's it being read right now, Mike?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, it's essentially uh Yeah.
Mike Martin: email.
Mike Metoyer: Uh I I don't know. Uh that's a question for Mike Martin. I think he has it uh based on email, the contacts.
Mike Martin: Yeah. Yeah. So uh the the flow goes uh email which goes uh which is a contact and um HubSpot automatically generates uh the primary company associated with the contact as long as it's uh a URL that's readable. So, if it's Mike M at Gmail, then it wouldn't create a uh company associated with Mike Martin because it's a Gmail account. So, there are some scenarios like that in HubSpot, but for the most part, that's how it's set up currently where it's automated by URL uh on the email. How how confident do you guys feel about the organization of the companies in in HubSpot where we can reference that as far as like okay so this company belongs to this chain HubSpot I feel we haven't done a
 
 
00:22:21
 
Mike Metoyer: I don't think we should go that route, but what do you what do you think, Martin?
Mike Martin: lot of hygiene anything that's been done has been automated that's probably going to be accurate but when it's um there are some situations where there's secondary tertiary level like Schwaz is a good example where it's not smart enough to read that and then we've been some people have been doing it by hand where they they have uh uh star buds and then they show primary is schwaz secondary is emeralds fields and they've been kind of just uh dragging and dropping that. So the question we have to ask ourselves is so everything in in Dynamics is driven by company uh billing um and everything pretty much in HubSpot's driven by contact and shipping. So that's where we're going to have to think through how do we combine how how do we merge the data? The origin is always big commerce. So we there should be a unique identifier. Yeah. It's an email right now and that's where problem lies.
 
 
00:23:40
 
Mike Martin: It should be a unique identifier that is a customer ID. It should not be an email or a contact or anything that's going to constantly evolve or change. That's a mistake. It should be ran by some form of customer number. Um and even with that there should be a hierarchy within the customer numbers. You can make your customer numbers however you want. So if I decided that one, two was curleaf, then I've got a hund, you know, 200 stores or whatever after that that I know everything one, two is curleaf, one, two, one is cure leaf one. One, two, two is cure leaf two, one, two, three is curle leaf four. Um, and you can push that all the way out through all of your MSOs through your unique identifiers. Or you can just do them chronologically. Just throw them in, you know, customer one through 10,00. But in either case, in my opinion, that's the way it should be.
Mike Metoyer: So, so how we have it right now is that unique identifier is in the uh the URL up top.
 
 
00:24:38
 
Mike Metoyer: So, for instance, I'm on Guushi's account. uh their bastard account is 13621. So ultimately before we we do this integration with uh dynamics to HubSpot there is a field in HubSpot on this bottom I just added it big commerce customer ID number. So there has to be a workflow where we can get that number and plug it into here. So when we're doing our our our lookup or whatever for Dynamics and our HubSpot customers, it's an automatic match and and we don't have to worry about it. So ideally I would Yeah.
Mike Martin: Who who has this connector right now? Who has the most information on this connector? And whoever's running this connector right now for us is the person that can I mean that's just another addition. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: So based on this make web better, it looks like Danny um was the one that was kind of touching it um last, but this was a couple years ago. This was last year in 2024. So, um I'm not 100% sure.
Mike Martin: Danny, Zach, any input is is adding That field going to be a problem.
 
 
00:25:43
 
Zach Ungerman: Yeah, we just uh Go ahead, Danny. But yeah, that's that's what the connection between HubSpot and BigCom is. That's what we use it. We got we have to look into it. So today we can
Daniel Bagaporo: So the thing about that is make web better has its own specific set of parameters that it looks for. I'm looking at its configurations and it looks like that maybe I can I can look around and see what is in there but customer ID sync doesn't seem to be part of its uh automations. For example, um, uh, Matoyer, the, uh, the that Juicy customer ID, what was it again?
Mike Metoyer: Uh, it is going to be 13621.
Daniel Bagaporo: Okay, let me see. So, I'm going to share my screen in just a second here and kind of just uh show you how customer information gets ported over. And I'm going to use Juicy as an example. One second. So what you see right now is kind of like where everything that we see off of make web better.
 
 
00:27:10
 
Daniel Bagaporo: This is how customers are getting synced. It looks like that there are some missing fields here. And I went to go and look at this one in particular. Uh for whatever reason, this is pretty much what shows up in that in that contacts information, right? So, it's not sure where it's reading all of this information, but it's definitely just based off of it's it looks like it's based off of just like the email address. That's where the contact gets sync because email address is common between the customer uh information, the order information and so on, right? to sync off of the uh company ID or the customer group ID. There are two ways about that. The 13621 is the is essentially kind of like what I keep labeling as the BTOC portion of it, but there's also this company ID down here pulled through API which is the B2B uh company ID. So in terms of what to sync from where there are multiple avenues that we can kind of pull that kind of information.
 
 
00:28:19
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Oh wait I let me present sorry. Right. So this is uh so this is the the contact uh the company ID from B TOC 13621 entered up here and the return information is being pulled from the B2B record or API record. So there there are the the one thing that we need to get straight is where are we going to start pulling this information from? Because uh as I explained to Kenan, the original connector was built with B2C in mind, but then we eventually moved on to upgrading to kind of like a B2B environment in Big Commerce. And yeah.
Mike Martin: Yep. We never redesigned it when we start.
Mike Metoyer: What what's what's that line ID uh on number 23? Is that BC uh group ID 1362 something?
Daniel Bagaporo: uh at the top here.
Mike Metoyer: No, it's line 23. 1362. That's interesting.
Daniel Bagaporo: 923. Oh, yeah.
Zach Ungerman: 1362. Yeah.
Mike Metoyer: It's missing the one.
Daniel Bagaporo: Looks like that, huh? Let me see. Let me try pulling it up.
 
 
00:29:49
 
Mike Metoyer: And and if we need to do this as a whole group, that's totally cool. If if not, we can do this offline up the meeting just so we don't waste everybody's time.
Daniel Bagaporo: Right.
Mike Martin: And here's the thing. I I I think we probably do need to go offline, but again, my my whole goal of this, I don't want to take everyone's time. It's Friday. Everyone's got a lot of s*** to do. I just want to get some deadlines and some true expectations because what's happening for me is there's all of these projects that are all involved in this one thing that I've just explained to everybody. because they're all bottlenecked at this point. I feel like there's a lot of people going everything's on hold because Keenan wants two weeks and I need to make sure that that isn't the case. And if it is the case that we're doing everything we can in the background in lie of what he's doing and then if we're we've done all that then we're providing all the resources that are necessary to shut this two weeks down to three or four days.
 
 
00:30:45
 
Mike Martin: Okay. Have one more question. Matoyer, do you are you organizing based on HubSpot or any of your other data besides Dynamics um the hierarchy or all the different um delivery addresses for your chains that we can also cross reference
Mike Metoyer: Uh I personally don't have a spreadsheet but uh the best uh location to do that is the B2B app uh in Big Commerce uh because that's where we set parent child accounts and the junior senior buyers.
Mike Martin: Bill can help with that. Okay. Sounds good. Export. I'm wondering if we should do a overarching document that maps how we're uh data hygiene and the cadence of what we're doing. We're going to do this first. We're going to do this second. We're going to do this. Mike is doing it as far as the hierarchy goes. Um I we just and then the order of sequence. Yes. Because Yeah. We're going to have to review that. Yes. Right now I have I'm doing it by uh shipping address from Big Commerce, tying it to the account number and dynamics.
 
 
00:32:01
 
Mike Martin: Yeah. Then tying it back to the customer name and then region and kind of doing a reverse engineer to see if our information is right. What I think would help is that because there's a lot of information that's just in people's heads about customer hierarchies that we don't know that isn't mapped out in dynamics. If Mike, you or the sales team wanted to find out a way to create your own mockup of parent child relationships as far as we have that emerald intel. Perfect. That's 100% correct. Perfect. Then we use that to compare against mine and then we iterate those two and create a decision matrix on what is really the deciding factor. Is it the email shipping address or is it a mixture of both? Which one takes precedence over the other? Right. So what do we need to do to get that done? Uh well the Emerald Intel um did the parent child mapping so that's that's accurate. So and that's a that's a a pivot table spreadsheet.
 
 
00:33:01
 
Mike Martin: Have you seen that? Alex, is that what you shared with me uh last year? Something that Alex worked on.
Alex Mazzei: That that was the CSV. It's a CSV file, but it also has all the customers in the industry, not only their their uh and the the customers. So, it's like a master masterly of all of the parent child relationships based on their um mechanism that they use to identify which ones are parent and child.
Mike Martin: See, that's something we could use on the customer intake side where it's predictive in a sense where if we have a location that we didn't previously have, it would recommend the customer uh setup in dynamics.
Alex Mazzei: And the way I was looking at it was this is the closest
Mike Martin: So I'll take a look at that um distill it down to what our customers are and then do a onetoone match. All right.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, quick question for Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: So we work on that.
Daniel Bagaporo: Uh, do we have a HubSpot developer environment?
Mike Martin: Yes. I do not believe we do.
 
 
00:34:09
 
Daniel Bagaporo: Because from there, I can probably dig into HubSpot's API capabilities and kind of see what can be pulled from HubSpot and maybe we can find some connections that way.
Mike Martin: Um,
Alex Mazzei: I believe you have a sandbox with the account that you have that you're paying for with HubSpot.
Daniel Bagaporo: Well, maybe because I'm looking to get into its actual developer environment uh where it can like expose web hooks and API calls.
Alex Mazzei: Is that what you're asking?
Mike Martin: We don't have our phone.
Alex Mazzei: Stop. Look at the documentation.
Mike Martin: Yeah, but we don't have the credentials. There is docu There is API documentation for sure and Danny's probably looking at it, but we don't have a a dedicated environment for ourselves. I'm not aware of it anyways.
Daniel Bagaporo: Gotcha.
Mike Martin: All right. Um, so you're going to work on that. You got that Excel sheet. Yeah. Okay. So, you're going to work on that. You're going to meet with Stravo and you're going to get back.
 
 
00:35:08
 
Mike Martin: I need you to put something on the calendar for Monday or Tuesday. Right. So, we have action items there. Alex, can can you update me on this $80,000 or $80,000 this $80,000 part cleanup data cleanup that we were doing in in in HubSpot? I know we we had talked about it and and I don't know if we put any tools in place to kind of scrub it and consolidate. Um, but after talking to Mike here, it sounds like he's as good or if not better than I am in Excel, which means maybe we can have him work on some of that scrub if we haven't done it already. Um, can anyone, whether it's Alex or Matoyer, update me on where we're at with the HubSpot cleanup?
Mike Metoyer: Yeah, I I haven't really seen seen too much.
Mike Martin: We haven't done anything.
Alex Mazzei: The only thing that I did was I took the Emerald Intel information and pinned it with the information that I got from the customer table from the dynamics and then once I was getting a confirmation from that I was going to move into if it made sense with the HubSpot and do the same approach but I have to break it down by state because the the information is too much to run with one one sweep.
 
 
00:36:26
 
Mike Martin: So these are the tentacles I'm talking about why it's why I wanted to have this.
Zach Ungerman: Oh, okay.
Mike Martin: So you're working on a project that he he can't move forward until you're done.
Zach Ungerman: So on on Phil by
Mike Martin: Okay. Right. So understanding that puts us in a place where I need you to help me prioritize his time where I get Alex what he needs so I can move this project forward. Okay. So he's going to work on that for you, Alex. He'll get that back to you. He'll put a timet on it after he looks at it. I'll have him send you an email on where we're at with that. Um you're going to set a meeting up. We'll meet again next week. I'm sorry I can't hear you.
Zach Ungerman: by scrub. Uh, do we are we talking about what Martin and the three of us have been talking about for a while? Data hygiene. Is that what we're talking about?
 
 
00:37:14
 
Zach Ungerman: Because we we kind of kind of we've been sitting here talking about data hygiene, but who's doing the data hygiene?
Mike Martin: Yes.
Zach Ungerman: Like, is that Mike?
Alex Mazzei: Hey,
Mike Martin: Literally what we just talked about.
Zach Ungerman: Okay.
Mike Martin: So Mike Mets has a template from Intel uh intelligence, whatever the hell that the third word party.
Zach Ungerman: Mike Mets. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Mike Martin: He's going to match that to his own records for the parent child. We're going to come up with the parent child relationships and through the parent child relationships, he's going to give that back to Alex. Alex is then going to use that as confirmed data and then scrub the rest of it and get rid of all the ones that shouldn't be there and give that back to us. At that point, someone has to then be in charge of uploading it back into HubSpot and getting the act the data loaded. So, who's going to do that? Jim. Sure. Okay. So, I'm on the same page and everyone else here understands. It's in Mike Mets's court right now. It's going to be passed to Alex. Alex then's going to get it to Kenan. Kenan's going to set a meeting on Monday to tell us what Strao said so we can shorten down our timeline and get back to our intel intelligence conversation and build that in. By next Wednesday, everybody should have a lot more clarity. Do I understand this right? Everybody out there, is that your understanding? Danny, Zack, Mike.
Zach Ungerman: Y yeah.
Mike Metoyer: Yep.
Mike Martin: All right, let's go after it, guys.
Mike Metoyer: The only thing I ask is The only thing I ask is before we do any imports uh to HubSpot uh just to verify with me or Mike Martin.
Mike Martin: Let's do it.
Mike Metoyer: But that's it.
Mike Martin: It's got to be done in sandbox and and we got to have a HubSpot sandbox. I don't want to f*** everything up worse than we already have.
Mike Metoyer: Go.
Mike Martin: All right. Anything else?
Daniel Bagaporo: No.

00:00:00
 
Justin Pryor: Hey, Alex. Sorry it took me a minute.
Alex Mazzei: Give me like 30 seconds. I just got to finish one thing. All right.
Justin Pryor: Oh, you're good.
Alex Mazzei: All right. All right, I'm back.
Justin Pryor: Hey. Yeah, it's been a uh crazy morning. My normal commute of 25 minutes took uh three hours today. It was a a a crane tipped over on one highway, blocked one way, and then uh like an 80,000 lb uh like uh asphalt uh machine fell off the back of a semi on on the main highway here. So, uh was a fun fun drive in, but uh I'm here now.
Alex Mazzei: Well, welcome.
Justin Pryor: Um but uh um yeah, I just wanted to uh touch base. Um I know Ben um I think he's still working on uh on uh mapping all those SKs. Um but uh also um once we get that done uh the next thing is uh to uh work on having um the computer order uh or generate suggestive POS. Um I just kind of wanted to see what uh your thoughts were on the best way to get that accomplished.
 
 
00:44:05
 
Alex Mazzei: Can you explain to me what that means?
Justin Pryor: Sorry. Um, so, so basically I I just um Brett wants uh he he would like our uh our system to like if I uh if I click a button or whatever or or even better if it just does it automatically if it if it notices, hey, you know, it takes two months to get here for this product. You need to order it uh you know, within this week or whatever. and then just kind of just have the system based off of our inventory and sales rate just kind of uh you know create a a suggestive PO that'll that'll list uh um the SKs that we currently need to
Alex Mazzei: All
Justin Pryor: order and the suggested quantities. That's essentially what what Brett has has described to me that he would like
Alex Mazzei: right. Okay. So, I need specifics. Where does the information live for the timelines of how long it takes to get and where does the information of inventory that's being used? Is that Microsoft Dynamics?
 
 
00:45:16
 
Alex Mazzei: Like what are the different pieces that hold the different pieces of information that we're using as the source of truth?
Justin Pryor: Um so the uh the source of of truth is going to be dynamics. Um that's where we pull our uh our run rate for items, the sales rate, and then how the uh um that's also where we pull our our current inventory from as well. Um so the source of truth is going to be dynamics. Um the uh the rate at which the products move uh or the the rate at which uh the vendors get products here um varies greatly by vendor. So I I can send you a list of uh just um kind of uh ship um ship transit times per vendor. um just a breakdown just I I can just get really granular and just send you over that um info and then uh you know if need be um I can I'm more than happy to upload spreadsheets of data that show sales rates into like uh I'm more than happy to feed that into what whatever system I need to as far as uh just pulling like uh monthly sales rates.
 
 
00:46:32
 
Justin Pryor: I think it's best to do it per month and then have it aggregate the data um just based off of the fact that different months have different uh different run rates. But uh but yeah, I can feed in all the individual skew run rates and the lead times. I have no problem doing that. I I just more so need to know. I'm just kind of curious uh what program would be the best for me to do that or if there was a program that we could uh tie into Dynamics that uh that kind of went handinhand with it. I'm I'm just not really sure what the best way to go about this is um so the uh the lead
Alex Mazzei: So in my mind what I hear is being able to take the data that you have is is static or is it update the lead time?
Justin Pryor: time is essentially static. I mean, you know, like for just for to throw it out there like the uh for domestic vendors, the majority of them I would say is about a a one to two week lead time and then for China vendors it's it's more of a a probably more of a two and a half to four month lead time kind of in that range and uh Indian vendors is going to be kind of the same time range within
 
 
00:47:44
 
Alex Mazzei: All
Justin Pryor: uh anywhere from about two and a half to four months.
Alex Mazzei: right.
Justin Pryor: Got the head movements down.
Alex Mazzei: So, yeah, I've been there too many times. Um, all right. So, that information will most likely make sense inside of a Google sheet or a CSV file. From there, we go and either do one of two things. Pull the data out of Microsoft Dynamics via API and match it with the SKUs or whatever you're using as your mapping system to uh establish something. Then create a new Google sheet um that has all the like these are the things that are coming up this month that you need to be aware of. And then you create a user interface that's in a more visual stimulating way using the data that's being generated on that Google sheet. So you have two ways
Justin Pryor: Yeah. And sorry. Um, uh, the other thing I was going to say is, uh, it's possible for me to just, you know, feed it sales data once a month.
 
 
00:49:00
 
Justin Pryor: Um, just kind of feed it an Excel file with the previous month's sales data. What to do is, uh, just kind of be pulling from that. um maybe like once a week or or whenever it's able to. Um but uh preferably I would like it to be able to automatically pull info out of dynamics. Um but I can upload if if need be. That was that was it. I just wanted to say that
Alex Mazzei: So I think the best solution is to have a manual one in case something happens to the automation. So you have the tool that you're able to do it manually and then phase two is to automate the whole thing and have the backup as a relay like redundancy like just in case something happens and it didn't do what it needs to do. You have both options.
Justin Pryor: Okay. Um yeah, let's start with the the manual one and then then we can move into doing the other one.
Alex Mazzei: All right. Anything else?
 
 
00:49:58
 
Justin Pryor: Um no, I think that should be it. uh um just let me know uh what you need from me or where I I need to to upload this data to. But uh I'll uh I'll start by getting you over the vendor lead times um just because that's going to be for the most part uh just how it always is. Um but uh the uh the skew run rates change on a regular basis. So I'll wait for your prompt to uh to start sending that over. the way I was doing it with chat GPT u chat GPT just wasn't powerful enough um initially um to uh to analyze all the data I was feeding it but what I was doing was I was uh I was feeding it like I started with our our vendor that we get the most SKUs from um and I basically started probably about two years ago and began to uh kind of feed it uh you know January's uh total monthly sales in Februaries and and I kind of just uploaded the the monthly sales uh for like the past year two years up to current for that vendor um just as a kind of a trial run and uh it it proved that you know even that vendor um it was uh just wasn't handling the data and uh initially um it said I wasn't uploading it in a format that it could um access very well.
 
 
00:51:21
 
Justin Pryor: Um, and then, uh, it kind of was flip-flopping back and forth on that. And then I finally got it to admit that it just said, you know, it doesn't have the, uh, capacity to be able to analyze that large amount of, of data that I fed into it.
Alex Mazzei: Do you have the chat window that you were trying to do this that we could just copy and look at what you were trying to do? That that would be useful.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Yeah. No, I made sure to save all that in a word W word file so that it would be easy for me to to train whatever one I use next.
Alex Mazzei: All right. Yeah. So, send me that. And then the other thing I'm thinking is Oh, by the way, I sent your avatar to the gym. So, he's got a six-pack now.
Justin Pryor: Hopefully hopefully within six months I'll be able to to live up to my avatar.
Alex Mazzei: Um, but yeah, I think um just get me the things that you were trying to do and I I just need to talk to Keen to see if they're able to give me these API keys and things like that.
 
 
00:52:18
 
Alex Mazzei: Like I they're they're looking I I put a whole bunch of videos together and they're like, ""Oh, how come all this stuff doesn't have screen sharing stuff?"" And I'm like, ""Cuz I don't have the same view that the other people have. So what? Am I going to make it with some bogus data points that I have or whatever? You know, like it's just dumb.
Justin Pryor: Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, it is what it is.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Yeah. No. Um I'll uh yeah, I'll talk to Kenan about it, too. Um just to kind of poke his brain on it. But uh yeah, I'll send you over the chat files from before and I will uh um also start working on the uh the lead times for you. And then um once uh once you got all that process, just let me know what's up.
Alex Mazzei: So one thing I don't not that you need to learn this but I think the move would be to use a tool that's inside the suite of Microsoft already.
 
 
00:53:08
 
Alex Mazzei: It's called Power Automate and that's the same functionality as the NAN that I was telling you about. So it has the ability to create the workflows and I I think once we have everything and instead of using Google Sheets you use either Excel or Google Sheets and then have everything in a place that you can
Justin Pryor: Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: see it. And then I'll just create a user interface to make it more visually stimulating.
Justin Pryor: Okay. All right. Yeah, that uh that sounds good to me. Um yeah, we'll uh I think I should be able to get you over everything that you need within the next couple hours. Um, and then um, and then yeah, you can just let me know when you're you're ready for more data and I'll be more than happy to get that over. But, uh, I got a What's up?
Alex Mazzei: Also, one last thing I think on sorry to cut you off. Phil was saying that in the meeting this morning, I don't know if you were there or not or if it was this morning.
 
 
00:54:01
 
Alex Mazzei: It was yesterday. I don't even know what day it is. Um, they added password protection to Love Buds, which interferes with the code that I built that was scraping our prices.
Justin Pryor: Oh, yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, he told me not to waste any time on it. I don't know if it makes sense just to give me the password, username, and password so I can just have a version that's working or not. I don't know. It's up to you. But I just wanted you to be aware that that price tool doesn't work anymore because of the password protection on love butts.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's it's no problem. We'll get you over a uh password and username and hopefully that'll fix that issue since we're able to scrape the other password protected sites.
Alex Mazzei: Yeah. But other than that, um I created the two video tutorials for receiving and picking and packing.
Justin Pryor: But
Alex Mazzei: I don't know if there's any specific information that you would like the rest of the company to know about, but that might be something to also think about.
 
 
00:54:58
 
Alex Mazzei: If there's certain things that your department does that would just be easy for them because you have to constantly remind them or tell them things, we can create a little video. So, you just send them that video or have them go through the the containers.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Um, so, uh, um, yeah, I don't think like the the warehouse necessarily has anything that that, uh, that I would need to add into there that would help them do their jobs better. Um, and as far as, uh, as far as these guys go, um, we kind of all have our own lanes. Um, so they don't really, you know, dip into my area too much and vice versa. Um, luckily, uh, both my employees are very capable and, uh, um, I don't really have to, uh, um, feed them too much or or, uh, oversee them too often. But, uh, um, so yeah, I don't think I necessarily need like a a video training um, for anything, but uh, I will get you over the the password and username and and everything else uh, that you need today.
 
 
00:56:06
 
Alex Mazzei: All right. Just wanted to put it out there in case you have anything that you want to share outside of your department to the rest of the company, not necessarily procurement.
Justin Pryor: Oh yeah. Yeah. No, I appreciate it. If I uh um if I think of anything uh that that that would be useful for, I'll uh I'll definitely let you know. I'm sure people would probably look at that thing would rather look at that talk in the morning meetings than me. Um so maybe I'll I'll try to come up
Alex Mazzei: No, but but think about think about this too. If a new hireer comes in, maybe it's just a quick overview of what the procurement process is. So, a new a recruit or new um hireer actually understands what the hell you guys actually do. So, you're just creating a frame and it could be like three to five minutes. It doesn't have to be long, you know.
Justin Pryor: Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: All
Justin Pryor: Yeah, definitely. I'll um I'll definitely take that into consideration and um and you know, see if there's any um anything any way that that uh can help other people in the company out and I'll uh I'll let you know if I come up with anything.
 
 
00:57:05
 
Alex Mazzei: right, buddy.
Justin Pryor: All right. Uh um yeah, just uh give me uh probably 3 4 hours and I'll I'll have everything over to you, you know, hopefully before then. Um definitely by end of day.
Alex Mazzei: And if you use a GPA, a GPS app, try ways.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Yeah, it was it was a weird one this morning because uh I I was literally trapped on an exit uh on an offramp on an exit for two hours. There was there was just no way out. I was uh like I I did that at a certain point, but the shoulder was blocked.
Alex Mazzei: Once you have a Subaru, I'd be driving on the side of the road. What are you talking? Nobody's stopping me.
Justin Pryor: Um so once I got past the blockage, I uh I just took the shoulder for a good portion of the way. Um other people with bigger cars weren't so lucky, but uh um but yeah, that I think that's probably saved me like another 30 minutes this morning.

00:54:01
 
Alex Mazzei: It was yesterday. I don't even know what day it is. Um, they added password protection to Love Buds, which interferes with the code that I built that was scraping our prices.
Justin Pryor: Oh, yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, he told me not to waste any time on it. I don't know if it makes sense just to give me the password, username, and password so I can just have a version that's working or not. I don't know. It's up to you. But I just wanted you to be aware that that price tool doesn't work anymore because of the password protection on love butts.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's it's no problem. We'll get you over a uh password and username and hopefully that'll fix that issue since we're able to scrape the other password protected sites.
Alex Mazzei: Yeah. But other than that, um I created the two video tutorials for receiving and picking and packing.
Justin Pryor: But
Alex Mazzei: I don't know if there's any specific information that you would like the rest of the company to know about, but that might be something to also think about.
 
 
00:54:58
 
Alex Mazzei: If there's certain things that your department does that would just be easy for them because you have to constantly remind them or tell them things, we can create a little video. So, you just send them that video or have them go through the the containers.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Um, so, uh, um, yeah, I don't think like the the warehouse necessarily has anything that that, uh, that I would need to add into there that would help them do their jobs better. Um, and as far as, uh, as far as these guys go, um, we kind of all have our own lanes. Um, so they don't really, you know, dip into my area too much and vice versa. Um, luckily, uh, both my employees are very capable and, uh, um, I don't really have to, uh, um, feed them too much or or, uh, oversee them too often. But, uh, um, so yeah, I don't think I necessarily need like a a video training um, for anything, but uh, I will get you over the the password and username and and everything else uh, that you need today.
 
 
00:56:06
 
Alex Mazzei: All right. Just wanted to put it out there in case you have anything that you want to share outside of your department to the rest of the company, not necessarily procurement.
Justin Pryor: Oh yeah. Yeah. No, I appreciate it. If I uh um if I think of anything uh that that that would be useful for, I'll uh I'll definitely let you know. I'm sure people would probably look at that thing would rather look at that talk in the morning meetings than me. Um so maybe I'll I'll try to come up
Alex Mazzei: No, but but think about think about this too. If a new hireer comes in, maybe it's just a quick overview of what the procurement process is. So, a new a recruit or new um hireer actually understands what the hell you guys actually do. So, you're just creating a frame and it could be like three to five minutes. It doesn't have to be long, you know.
Justin Pryor: Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: All
Justin Pryor: Yeah, definitely. I'll um I'll definitely take that into consideration and um and you know, see if there's any um anything any way that that uh can help other people in the company out and I'll uh I'll let you know if I come up with anything.
 
 
00:57:05
 
Alex Mazzei: right, buddy.
Justin Pryor: All right. Uh um yeah, just uh give me uh probably 3 4 hours and I'll I'll have everything over to you, you know, hopefully before then. Um definitely by end of day.
Alex Mazzei: And if you use a GPA, a GPS app, try ways.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Yeah, it was it was a weird one this morning because uh I I was literally trapped on an exit uh on an offramp on an exit for two hours. There was there was just no way out. I was uh like I I did that at a certain point, but the shoulder was blocked.
Alex Mazzei: Once you have a Subaru, I'd be driving on the side of the road. What are you talking? Nobody's stopping me.
Justin Pryor: Um so once I got past the blockage, I uh I just took the shoulder for a good portion of the way. Um other people with bigger cars weren't so lucky, but uh um but yeah, that I think that's probably saved me like another 30 minutes this morning.

Meeting Sep 3, 2025 at 12:46 EDT - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Justin Pryor: Hey, Alex. Sorry it took me a minute.
Alex Mazzei: Give me like 30 seconds. I just got to finish one thing. All right.
Justin Pryor: Oh, you're good.
Alex Mazzei: All right. All right, I'm back.
Justin Pryor: Hey. Yeah, it's been a uh crazy morning. My normal commute of 25 minutes took uh three hours today. It was a a a crane tipped over on one highway, blocked one way, and then uh like an 80,000 lb uh like uh asphalt uh machine fell off the back of a semi on on the main highway here. So, uh was a fun fun drive in, but uh I'm here now.
Alex Mazzei: Well, welcome.
Justin Pryor: Um but uh um yeah, I just wanted to uh touch base. Um I know Ben um I think he's still working on uh on uh mapping all those SKs. Um but uh also um once we get that done uh the next thing is uh to uh work on having um the computer order uh or generate suggestive POS. Um I just kind of wanted to see what uh your thoughts were on the best way to get that accomplished.
 
 
00:44:05
 
Alex Mazzei: Can you explain to me what that means?
Justin Pryor: Sorry. Um, so, so basically I I just um Brett wants uh he he would like our uh our system to like if I uh if I click a button or whatever or or even better if it just does it automatically if it if it notices, hey, you know, it takes two months to get here for this product. You need to order it uh you know, within this week or whatever. and then just kind of just have the system based off of our inventory and sales rate just kind of uh you know create a a suggestive PO that'll that'll list uh um the SKs that we currently need to
Alex Mazzei: All
Justin Pryor: order and the suggested quantities. That's essentially what what Brett has has described to me that he would like
Alex Mazzei: right. Okay. So, I need specifics. Where does the information live for the timelines of how long it takes to get and where does the information of inventory that's being used? Is that Microsoft Dynamics?
 
 
00:45:16
 
Alex Mazzei: Like what are the different pieces that hold the different pieces of information that we're using as the source of truth?
Justin Pryor: Um so the uh the source of of truth is going to be dynamics. Um that's where we pull our uh our run rate for items, the sales rate, and then how the uh um that's also where we pull our our current inventory from as well. Um so the source of truth is going to be dynamics. Um the uh the rate at which the products move uh or the the rate at which uh the vendors get products here um varies greatly by vendor. So I I can send you a list of uh just um kind of uh ship um ship transit times per vendor. um just a breakdown just I I can just get really granular and just send you over that um info and then uh you know if need be um I can I'm more than happy to upload spreadsheets of data that show sales rates into like uh I'm more than happy to feed that into what whatever system I need to as far as uh just pulling like uh monthly sales rates.
 
 
00:46:32
 
Justin Pryor: I think it's best to do it per month and then have it aggregate the data um just based off of the fact that different months have different uh different run rates. But uh but yeah, I can feed in all the individual skew run rates and the lead times. I have no problem doing that. I I just more so need to know. I'm just kind of curious uh what program would be the best for me to do that or if there was a program that we could uh tie into Dynamics that uh that kind of went handinhand with it. I'm I'm just not really sure what the best way to go about this is um so the uh the lead
Alex Mazzei: So in my mind what I hear is being able to take the data that you have is is static or is it update the lead time?
Justin Pryor: time is essentially static. I mean, you know, like for just for to throw it out there like the uh for domestic vendors, the majority of them I would say is about a a one to two week lead time and then for China vendors it's it's more of a a probably more of a two and a half to four month lead time kind of in that range and uh Indian vendors is going to be kind of the same time range within
 
 
00:47:44
 
Alex Mazzei: All
Justin Pryor: uh anywhere from about two and a half to four months.
Alex Mazzei: right.
Justin Pryor: Got the head movements down.
Alex Mazzei: So, yeah, I've been there too many times. Um, all right. So, that information will most likely make sense inside of a Google sheet or a CSV file. From there, we go and either do one of two things. Pull the data out of Microsoft Dynamics via API and match it with the SKUs or whatever you're using as your mapping system to uh establish something. Then create a new Google sheet um that has all the like these are the things that are coming up this month that you need to be aware of. And then you create a user interface that's in a more visual stimulating way using the data that's being generated on that Google sheet. So you have two ways
Justin Pryor: Yeah. And sorry. Um, uh, the other thing I was going to say is, uh, it's possible for me to just, you know, feed it sales data once a month.
 
 
00:49:00
 
Justin Pryor: Um, just kind of feed it an Excel file with the previous month's sales data. What to do is, uh, just kind of be pulling from that. um maybe like once a week or or whenever it's able to. Um but uh preferably I would like it to be able to automatically pull info out of dynamics. Um but I can upload if if need be. That was that was it. I just wanted to say that
Alex Mazzei: So I think the best solution is to have a manual one in case something happens to the automation. So you have the tool that you're able to do it manually and then phase two is to automate the whole thing and have the backup as a relay like redundancy like just in case something happens and it didn't do what it needs to do. You have both options.
Justin Pryor: Okay. Um yeah, let's start with the the manual one and then then we can move into doing the other one.
Alex Mazzei: All right. Anything else?
 
 
00:49:58
 
Justin Pryor: Um no, I think that should be it. uh um just let me know uh what you need from me or where I I need to to upload this data to. But uh I'll uh I'll start by getting you over the vendor lead times um just because that's going to be for the most part uh just how it always is. Um but uh the uh the skew run rates change on a regular basis. So I'll wait for your prompt to uh to start sending that over. the way I was doing it with chat GPT u chat GPT just wasn't powerful enough um initially um to uh to analyze all the data I was feeding it but what I was doing was I was uh I was feeding it like I started with our our vendor that we get the most SKUs from um and I basically started probably about two years ago and began to uh kind of feed it uh you know January's uh total monthly sales in Februaries and and I kind of just uploaded the the monthly sales uh for like the past year two years up to current for that vendor um just as a kind of a trial run and uh it it proved that you know even that vendor um it was uh just wasn't handling the data and uh initially um it said I wasn't uploading it in a format that it could um access very well.
 
 
00:51:21
 
Justin Pryor: Um, and then, uh, it kind of was flip-flopping back and forth on that. And then I finally got it to admit that it just said, you know, it doesn't have the, uh, capacity to be able to analyze that large amount of, of data that I fed into it.
Alex Mazzei: Do you have the chat window that you were trying to do this that we could just copy and look at what you were trying to do? That that would be useful.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Yeah. No, I made sure to save all that in a word W word file so that it would be easy for me to to train whatever one I use next.
Alex Mazzei: All right. Yeah. So, send me that. And then the other thing I'm thinking is Oh, by the way, I sent your avatar to the gym. So, he's got a six-pack now.
Justin Pryor: Hopefully hopefully within six months I'll be able to to live up to my avatar.
Alex Mazzei: Um, but yeah, I think um just get me the things that you were trying to do and I I just need to talk to Keen to see if they're able to give me these API keys and things like that.
 
 
00:52:18
 
Alex Mazzei: Like I they're they're looking I I put a whole bunch of videos together and they're like, ""Oh, how come all this stuff doesn't have screen sharing stuff?"" And I'm like, ""Cuz I don't have the same view that the other people have. So what? Am I going to make it with some bogus data points that I have or whatever? You know, like it's just dumb.
Justin Pryor: Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, it is what it is.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Yeah. No. Um I'll uh yeah, I'll talk to Kenan about it, too. Um just to kind of poke his brain on it. But uh yeah, I'll send you over the chat files from before and I will uh um also start working on the uh the lead times for you. And then um once uh once you got all that process, just let me know what's up.
Alex Mazzei: So one thing I don't not that you need to learn this but I think the move would be to use a tool that's inside the suite of Microsoft already.
 
 
00:53:08
 
Alex Mazzei: It's called Power Automate and that's the same functionality as the NAN that I was telling you about. So it has the ability to create the workflows and I I think once we have everything and instead of using Google Sheets you use either Excel or Google Sheets and then have everything in a place that you can
Justin Pryor: Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: see it. And then I'll just create a user interface to make it more visually stimulating.
Justin Pryor: Okay. All right. Yeah, that uh that sounds good to me. Um yeah, we'll uh I think I should be able to get you over everything that you need within the next couple hours. Um, and then um, and then yeah, you can just let me know when you're you're ready for more data and I'll be more than happy to get that over. But, uh, I got a What's up?
Alex Mazzei: Also, one last thing I think on sorry to cut you off. Phil was saying that in the meeting this morning, I don't know if you were there or not or if it was this morning.
 
 
00:54:01
 
Alex Mazzei: It was yesterday. I don't even know what day it is. Um, they added password protection to Love Buds, which interferes with the code that I built that was scraping our prices.
Justin Pryor: Oh, yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, he told me not to waste any time on it. I don't know if it makes sense just to give me the password, username, and password so I can just have a version that's working or not. I don't know. It's up to you. But I just wanted you to be aware that that price tool doesn't work anymore because of the password protection on love butts.

00:49:58
 
Justin Pryor: Um no, I think that should be it. uh um just let me know uh what you need from me or where I I need to to upload this data to. But uh I'll uh I'll start by getting you over the vendor lead times um just because that's going to be for the most part uh just how it always is. Um but uh the uh the skew run rates change on a regular basis. So I'll wait for your prompt to uh to start sending that over. the way I was doing it with chat GPT u chat GPT just wasn't powerful enough um initially um to uh to analyze all the data I was feeding it but what I was doing was I was uh I was feeding it like I started with our our vendor that we get the most SKUs from um and I basically started probably about two years ago and began to uh kind of feed it uh you know January's uh total monthly sales in Februaries and and I kind of just uploaded the the monthly sales uh for like the past year two years up to current for that vendor um just as a kind of a trial run and uh it it proved that you know even that vendor um it was uh just wasn't handling the data and uh initially um it said I wasn't uploading it in a format that it could um access very well.
 
 
00:51:21
 
Justin Pryor: Um, and then, uh, it kind of was flip-flopping back and forth on that. And then I finally got it to admit that it just said, you know, it doesn't have the, uh, capacity to be able to analyze that large amount of, of data that I fed into it.
Alex Mazzei: Do you have the chat window that you were trying to do this that we could just copy and look at what you were trying to do? That that would be useful.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Yeah. No, I made sure to save all that in a word W word file so that it would be easy for me to to train whatever one I use next.
Alex Mazzei: All right. Yeah. So, send me that. And then the other thing I'm thinking is Oh, by the way, I sent your avatar to the gym. So, he's got a six-pack now.
Justin Pryor: Hopefully hopefully within six months I'll be able to to live up to my avatar.
Alex Mazzei: Um, but yeah, I think um just get me the things that you were trying to do and I I just need to talk to Keen to see if they're able to give me these API keys and things like that.
 
 
00:52:18
 
Alex Mazzei: Like I they're they're looking I I put a whole bunch of videos together and they're like, ""Oh, how come all this stuff doesn't have screen sharing stuff?"" And I'm like, ""Cuz I don't have the same view that the other people have. So what? Am I going to make it with some bogus data points that I have or whatever? You know, like it's just dumb.
Justin Pryor: Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, it is what it is.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Yeah. No. Um I'll uh yeah, I'll talk to Kenan about it, too. Um just to kind of poke his brain on it. But uh yeah, I'll send you over the chat files from before and I will uh um also start working on the uh the lead times for you. And then um once uh once you got all that process, just let me know what's up.
Alex Mazzei: So one thing I don't not that you need to learn this but I think the move would be to use a tool that's inside the suite of Microsoft already.
 
 
00:53:08
 
Alex Mazzei: It's called Power Automate and that's the same functionality as the NAN that I was telling you about. So it has the ability to create the workflows and I I think once we have everything and instead of using Google Sheets you use either Excel or Google Sheets and then have everything in a place that you can
Justin Pryor: Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: see it. And then I'll just create a user interface to make it more visually stimulating.
Justin Pryor: Okay. All right. Yeah, that uh that sounds good to me. Um yeah, we'll uh I think I should be able to get you over everything that you need within the next couple hours. Um, and then um, and then yeah, you can just let me know when you're you're ready for more data and I'll be more than happy to get that over. But, uh, I got a What's up?
Alex Mazzei: Also, one last thing I think on sorry to cut you off. Phil was saying that in the meeting this morning, I don't know if you were there or not or if it was this morning.
 
 
00:54:01
 
Alex Mazzei: It was yesterday. I don't even know what day it is. Um, they added password protection to Love Buds, which interferes with the code that I built that was scraping our prices.
Justin Pryor: Oh, yeah.
Alex Mazzei: So, he told me not to waste any time on it. I don't know if it makes sense just to give me the password, username, and password so I can just have a version that's working or not. I don't know. It's up to you. But I just wanted you to be aware that that price tool doesn't work anymore because of the password protection on love butts.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's it's no problem. We'll get you over a uh password and username and hopefully that'll fix that issue since we're able to scrape the other password protected sites.
Alex Mazzei: Yeah. But other than that, um I created the two video tutorials for receiving and picking and packing.
Justin Pryor: But
Alex Mazzei: I don't know if there's any specific information that you would like the rest of the company to know about, but that might be something to also think about.
 
 
00:54:58
 
Alex Mazzei: If there's certain things that your department does that would just be easy for them because you have to constantly remind them or tell them things, we can create a little video. So, you just send them that video or have them go through the the containers.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Um, so, uh, um, yeah, I don't think like the the warehouse necessarily has anything that that, uh, that I would need to add into there that would help them do their jobs better. Um, and as far as, uh, as far as these guys go, um, we kind of all have our own lanes. Um, so they don't really, you know, dip into my area too much and vice versa. Um, luckily, uh, both my employees are very capable and, uh, um, I don't really have to, uh, um, feed them too much or or, uh, oversee them too often. But, uh, um, so yeah, I don't think I necessarily need like a a video training um, for anything, but uh, I will get you over the the password and username and and everything else uh, that you need today.
 
 
00:56:06
 
Alex Mazzei: All right. Just wanted to put it out there in case you have anything that you want to share outside of your department to the rest of the company, not necessarily procurement.
Justin Pryor: Oh yeah. Yeah. No, I appreciate it. If I uh um if I think of anything uh that that that would be useful for, I'll uh I'll definitely let you know. I'm sure people would probably look at that thing would rather look at that talk in the morning meetings than me. Um so maybe I'll I'll try to come up
Alex Mazzei: No, but but think about think about this too. If a new hireer comes in, maybe it's just a quick overview of what the procurement process is. So, a new a recruit or new um hireer actually understands what the hell you guys actually do. So, you're just creating a frame and it could be like three to five minutes. It doesn't have to be long, you know.
Justin Pryor: Yeah.
Alex Mazzei: All
Justin Pryor: Yeah, definitely. I'll um I'll definitely take that into consideration and um and you know, see if there's any um anything any way that that uh can help other people in the company out and I'll uh I'll let you know if I come up with anything.
 
 
00:57:05
 
Alex Mazzei: right, buddy.
Justin Pryor: All right. Uh um yeah, just uh give me uh probably 3 4 hours and I'll I'll have everything over to you, you know, hopefully before then. Um definitely by end of day.
Alex Mazzei: And if you use a GPA, a GPS app, try ways.
Justin Pryor: Yeah. Yeah, it was it was a weird one this morning because uh I I was literally trapped on an exit uh on an offramp on an exit for two hours. There was there was just no way out. I was uh like I I did that at a certain point, but the shoulder was blocked.
Alex Mazzei: Once you have a Subaru, I'd be driving on the side of the road. What are you talking? Nobody's stopping me.
Justin Pryor: Um so once I got past the blockage, I uh I just took the shoulder for a good portion of the way. Um other people with bigger cars weren't so lucky, but uh um but yeah, that I think that's probably saved me like another 30 minutes this morning.
