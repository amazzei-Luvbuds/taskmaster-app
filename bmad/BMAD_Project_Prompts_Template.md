```

**Follow-up prompts for brainstorming:**
```
Can you help me explore different feature possibilities for this project?

What are the key user personas I should consider?

What potential technical challenges should I be aware of?

What would make this project unique in the market?
```

### **Step 3: Market Research (Optional but Recommended)**
```

```

### **Step 8: Create Development Stories**

**Cursor Chat Prompt:**
```
Initialize the Scrum Master agent to help me create epics and stories from the sharded documents.

@Scrum Master
/draft

Please analyze the sharded documents and create:
1. High-level epics for major features
2. Detailed user stories for each epic
3. Proper story prioritization
4. Dependencies between stories
```

### **Step 9: Start Development Cycle**

**For Each Story - Implementation Prompt:**
```
I'm ready to implement Story [X.X]. I've changed its status to "approved" in the story file.

@Dev

## üí° **Tips for Effective BMAD Usage**

### **General Best Practices:**
1. **Always start commands with `*`** - The framework requires this prefix
2. **Use numbered lists** - The agents respond well to structured input
3. **Be specific** - Provide context and details for better results
4. **Follow the sequence** - Don't skip phases unless you have a specific reason
5. **Stay in character** - Let each agent complete their work before switching

### **Troubleshooting Prompts:**
```
*help
*status
*agent [name] (to see available agents)
*task [name] (to see available tasks)
*exit (to return to orchestrator)
```

### **Emergency Reset:**
```
*exit
*help

I need to restart the BMAD process. Please reset to the BMad Orchestrator and show me available options.
