# Infrastructure and Deployment

## Infrastructure as Code
- **Tool:** Google Apps Script Manifest
- **Location:** `appsscript.json`
- **Approach:** Declarative configuration for permissions and runtime

## Deployment Strategy
- **Strategy:** Blue-Green deployment via Apps Script versions
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions with clasp
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Environments
- **Development:** Script Editor test deployments - For development and testing
- **Staging:** Versioned deployment with test users - Pre-production validation
- **Production:** Published web app deployment - Live environment for all users

## Environment Promotion Flow
```text
Development (Script Editor) 
    ↓ Test & Validate
Staging (Test Deployment) 
    ↓ User Acceptance
Production (Published Web App)
    ↓ Monitor & Rollback if needed
```

## Rollback Strategy
- **Primary Method:** Apps Script version rollback
- **Trigger Conditions:** Error rate >5%, Response time >8s
- **Recovery Time Objective:** <5 minutes
