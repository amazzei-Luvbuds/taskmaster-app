# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for Jarvis AI Assistant, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
Since this is a web-based application with significant UI components, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.
