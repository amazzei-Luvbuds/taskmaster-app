# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable employees to manage email, calendar, and tasks through natural language commands
- Reduce time spent on administrative tasks by 40% through intelligent automation
- Provide a unified interface for all Google Workspace interactions via voice or text
- Create intelligent meeting workflows including automated transcription and follow-up generation
- Establish a zero-infrastructure solution using only Google Apps Script for easy deployment

## Background Context
Modern knowledge workers spend significant time managing emails, scheduling meetings, and tracking tasks across multiple Google Workspace applications. This context switching reduces productivity and increases cognitive load. Jarvis AI Assistant addresses this by providing a conversational AI interface that orchestrates all workspace operations through natural language, allowing employees to focus on high-value work rather than administrative overhead. By leveraging Google Apps Script, we can deploy this solution without any external infrastructure, making it ideal for internal company use with minimal IT overhead.
