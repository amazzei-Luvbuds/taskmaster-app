# **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure**
*Priority: MUST DO FIRST*
*Dependencies: None*
*Estimated Stories: 5-6*

## Goal
Establish the Google Apps Script project foundation with authentication, basic web interface, and Gemini AI integration for all subsequent development.

## User Stories

### Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Configuration
