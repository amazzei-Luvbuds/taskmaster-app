# Story Prioritization & Dependencies

## Critical Path (Must Complete in Order):
1. **Epic 1** - All stories (Foundation required for everything)
2. **Epic 2, Stories 2.1-2.4** - Core chat and routing functionality
3. **Epic 2, Story 2.2 OR 2.3** - At least one agent for MVP
4. **Epic 3, Story 3.3** - Contact resolution (enhances email/calendar)

## Parallel Development Opportunities:
- **Epic 3** stories can be developed in parallel after Epic 2
- **Epic 4** voice features can be developed independently after Story 2.1
- **Epic 5** UI enhancements can begin after basic functionality works

## MVP Definition:
- **Minimum Viable Product**: Epic 1 + Epic 2 (Stories 2.1-2.3)
- **Enhanced MVP**: Add Epic 3 (Story 3.3) + Epic 4 (Story 4.1)
- **Full Product**: All epics complete

## Risk Mitigation:
- Start with Gmail OR Calendar agent, not both simultaneously
- Implement circuit breakers early to handle API limits
- Test execution time limits thoroughly with ExecutionManager
- Cache aggressively to minimize API calls

This structure provides a clear development path from foundation to full-featured AI assistant, with well-defined dependencies and the flexibility to adjust scope based on timeline and resources.
